"Clayton Fuge","""2018-11-25T18:50:07.000Z""","""GB""",7,false,5,"Always amazing prices and added extras!","The prices here are always competitive and often beat GAME, Amazon, ShopTo and more! I also like the fact they include a steelbook with some titles!

The only criticism I have currently is the absence of a wishlist on their website. This is especially problematic when upcoming titles are unavailable for pre-order. A wishlist would allow for a thorough browse of their stock. Furthermore, stock can appear a little limited at times which is not major but still a shame. For example, I tried looking for God of War yesterday but it was not present on their website.

In summary though, the positive things outweigh the negatives quite comfortably. Cheapest around 9 out of 10 times. Always quick to despatch and deliver and of course - an amazing team of well-rounded staff who always display amazing customer service.

It has the special 'local store' type feeling and doesn't feel like a large corporate company. I just love it here.

Thank you and I hope this review helps others 😊","null","[]",0,"5bfaeedf9d378009543f9b5c","""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/481735430000640005026c38/0x0.png""","https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.thegamecollection.net?languages=all&page=567","The Game Collection","Excellent",4.8,true,23369,"{""number"":21707,""percentage"":""92%""}","{""number"":615,""percentage"":""3%""}","{""number"":203,""percentage"":""<1%""}","{""number"":155,""percentage"":""<1%""}","{""number"":689,""percentage"":""3%""}","<p align=""center""><a href=""https://www.thegamecollection.net"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer""><img src=""https://cdn.trustpilot.net/consumersite-businessunitimages/481735430000640005026c38/profile-description/logo-inverted-176x70.png"" align=""center"" border=""0""></a></p><p>The Game Collection have built up an excellent reputation and loyal group of happy customers over the course of over 19 years of selling Video Games online.</p>

Even opting to pay for next-day delivery, the game worked out cheaper than any other sites at the time and delivery was very prompt, I can't honestly say anything about the customer service as I haven't had to deal with anybody regarding my purchase, but I will use the game collection again and have already made recommendations to friends to use their service.

I got the game for around £13 cheaper than any other website, which is a massive saving. The website is very easy to navigate, unlike some game sites I could mention. 
I recieved email updates to let me know when the game would be sent out and when it was sent out. Then I received an email with a game code for extras in the game that I wasn’t expecting, which is always a nice touch. 
The game arrived very well packaged and it also had a FREE Wolfenstein 2 branded bag which was even better. I can honestly say that I will be buying more games from them.

I had been wanting one for a while but was hoping the prices would drop a little before buying in, so I was really happy when I found that they were selling them for what I thought was a pretty reasonable price compared to some other outlets... At the time I didn't bother signing up for an account but after going back to look at their games realised that I was actually pretty likely going to go back and buy more from them so it was great when I had a friendly exchange with one of their support guys by email who hooked up the loyalty points I would have earned from buying the Switch to my new account so I could put it towards a game.

Their prices are usually lower than RRP, their sales are great, and the rewards scheme is fully awesome. Items are well packaged and always arrive in good condition - I’m not a “new in box” collector of amiibo but for those of you who are, damaged packaging has never been an issue when I’ve bought amiibo from TGC. The few times I’ve contacted their customer service, the response was quick, professional, and responsive to my needs.

Delivery times: Most recently for the Tears of the Kingdom launch, their delivery partner was Royal Mail who delivered both game and amiibo on release day, which was fab. Occasionally their delivery partners aren’t able to deliver things on release day, as was the case when I ordered a Switch OLED and arranged to work from home on the Friday I expected it, only to have DX not turn up till the next working day (Tuesday), but that is fully on the delivery partner and not TGC! One delivery I was expecting fell during a Royal Mail strike and so TCG used a different delivery partner who could deliver on release day - which is great from a customer service perspective (although I feel a bit scabby and in retrospect I could have postponed that order and more fully supported the strikers!). I know that some reviewers in the past have complained of products not arriving on release day but that is an issue you’ll get with any physical suppliers -sometimes unforeseen things happen on the road - but I was super impressed that TGC did as much as they could to mitigate any foreseen problems in advance. I’m intending to stick with them for most of my upcoming game purchases.","""2023-05-08T23:00:00.000Z""","[]",0,"646ca698c4234462866856ce","""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/481735430000640005026c38/0x0.png""","https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.thegamecollection.net?languages=all&page=244","The Game Collection","Excellent",4.8,true,23369,"{""number"":21707,""percentage"":""92%""}","{""number"":615,""percentage"":""3%""}","{""number"":203,""percentage"":""<1%""}","{""number"":155,""percentage"":""<1%""}","{""number"":689,""percentage"":""3%""}","<p align=""center""><a href=""https://www.thegamecollection.net"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer""><img src=""https://cdn.trustpilot.net/consumersite-businessunitimages/481735430000640005026c38/profile-description/logo-inverted-176x70.png"" align=""center"" border=""0""></a></p><p>The Game Collection have built up an excellent reputation and loyal group of happy customers over the course of over 19 years of selling Video Games online.</p>

I have shopped with them before and they were excellent. Today (Fri,Oct 20th,2023) is the official release date for Spider-Man 2 PS5 game. They dispatched it yesterday after issuing my points 2 days before which is unusual as they always dispatch the day they issue the points. 

Now royal mail have let me down and have NOT delivered the game. I emailed TGC, no response whatsoever. 

There are people like my friend who preordered the game from them as little as 2 weeks ago who received theirs yesterday! day before release as TheGameCollection dispatched theirs on Wednesday and had delivered it on Thursday.

But me, I pre-ordered in August but they ship mine on Thursday (fair enough, its day before official release but you would think first to order gets theirs dispatched first) but now its not even delivered. Utterly disappointed!

BUYERS BEWARE! Its just a matter of luck if they decide to ship yours 2 days before release where you receive it early but this is a highly anticipated game and they let me down. I don't even mind the fact that mind wasn't dispatched for early delivery but the fact that its release day and its not delivered. Shameful! 

Will return should it actually arrive as I will go and pick it up from Currys in store today which is supposedly £5 cheaper. Hopefully TheGameCollection do not charge for returns, will update this when everything is sorted based on my exprience.

Best to stick with Amazon, Currys and Smyths who use way more reliable couriers with up to date tracking like DPD.","""2023-10-20T00:00:00.000Z""","[]",1,"6532ab72e06db53af3b0371e","""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/481735430000640005026c38/0x0.png""","https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.thegamecollection.net?languages=all&page=122","The Game Collection","Excellent",4.8,true,23369,"{""number"":21707,""percentage"":""92%""}","{""number"":615,""percentage"":""3%""}","{""number"":203,""percentage"":""<1%""}","{""number"":155,""percentage"":""<1%""}","{""number"":689,""percentage"":""3%""}","<p align=""center""><a href=""https://www.thegamecollection.net"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer""><img src=""https://cdn.trustpilot.net/consumersite-businessunitimages/481735430000640005026c38/profile-description/logo-inverted-176x70.png"" align=""center"" border=""0""></a></p><p>The Game Collection have built up an excellent reputation and loyal group of happy customers over the course of over 19 years of selling Video Games online.</p>

Plus you get a discount voucher with every game bought from their eBay shop or you can open an account and receive reward points...it all adds up. I have ordered from both, delivery is free and games normally arrive in a couple of days if ordered before 3pm.
The one time i had a problem with my order customer service was first class. Return was freepost and my problem was rectified in less than 24hrs (nice one Jack).

"Sam","""2019-11-27T09:25:02.000Z""","""GB""",11,false,4,"So glad I managed to find The Game…","So glad I managed to find The Game Collection. I was previously ordering games from Game and Amazon, but The Game Collection has far better pricing and customer service. 

Reason it’s not a 5 star rating is due to the pre order system:
