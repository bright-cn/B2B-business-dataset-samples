Around noon I went to Bronze's Tequeria and noticed a shop next door that read manicure and pedicures... new to the neighborhood I was excited to see a nail salon so close to my home and near a good restaurant and charge station!
Lets start the gift giving... 1st gift, I walk in and am greeted by Wendy's warm welcome and she lets me know she's available and the restaurant can bring my food to the salon after I order.  So did just that, ordered and told them I was next door. 2nd gift, Wendy was ready for me as I came back through the door, a walk-in's dream! 3rd gift, as she's doing my pedi she advises I shouldn't put nail polish back on because my nails need a break... she genuinely cares about her customers, other people have just painted over the discoloration from leaving nail polish on too long.
Now the 4th gift was unexpected!  I went in for a mani and pedi and Wendy had time, thank god, to do my hair too!  My thick 4C hair... she hooked it up! I went in around 12p and was done by 2:10p!
YES... mani, pedi and hair (press and curl) done in about 2hrs!!!!!

"hula-boba-kapolei-kapolei","""12/05/2020""",5,"=== 1. VERDICT/VALUE
Fun for kids of all ages - this may be the only bubble tea topping buffet in Hawaii :)  With good prices and a unique experience, this should be on your list of BBT places in town!

=== 2. FOOD
Do-it-yourself drinks may not be more fun!  Simply walk in, choose a small or large cup, indulge at the topping buffet - all range of boba, jelly, etc. are available - and then tell the staff what sort of beverage you want.

Be careful, it's easy to get carried away with the yummy toppings!  You get to fill your cup to the first line on the cup for free; thereafter it's $0.75 above the first line and $2 after the second line.

One this day, we got a small signature milk tea - quick dispensed and sealed by the staff.  The small milk teas are $5.50 and the large is $0.50 more.

=== 3. SERVICE & ENVIRONMENT
It's normally very busy here due to the joint's popularity and also because you have to wait for the patrons before you fill their cups at the topping buffet.  The staff are typically friendly and fast.  The decor is colorful!  There are snacks and decorations of all shapes, sizes, and colors, making it great for those with little ones to stay and look around.  There are only a couple of really small tables so your party better be 3 people or less when dining in is permitted; this also implies that wheelchairs and strollers (like our small single one) don't fit in here well.  Parking is readily available in the shopping complex lot.","{""Friends"":123,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/Of1TB9uZLwQEOR2nR4mGNQ/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Vancouver, Canada"",""Photos"":2459,""Reviews_made"":647,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=N1ozXPKgvToSP-Q5bQNmzA"",""Username"":""Jack W.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/26Pk7eLa8xD7VBej_pxalA/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":5,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":6,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",8,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","Hula Boba Kapolei",""

I was greeted with extremely warm customer service. The staff made you feel like family! The staff looked young and around my age group (in their 20's). They all worked as a team and in unison. I really admired this, because it is unfortunately rare to see this kind of quality service these days. 

It is outdoor seating, and it has a nice upbeat and soothing feel to it, with the Christmas lights strewn and the colorful tables arranged. 

I ordered the seafood enchiladas for my main course, and chips and salsa as my appetizer. The chips were nice and fresh, and the salsa was bold and flavorful with a nice kick of spice! I really took my time eating the chips, as they soothed the soul with each bite.

The seafood enchiladas were recommend by my waitress & man oh man was she not lying! They came smothered with a chipotle sauce, a piece of grilled shrimp and grilled salmon on top! + stuffed with crab and lobster meat, in addition to a side of rice and beans!  My mouth is watering just reliving the experience of this meal! So, the enchiladas were just MMM MMM GOOD!!! The chipotle sauce created a warm element, while the fresh seafood echoed elements of freshness and flavors with a mesquite grill char. The rice and beans had so much warmth in each and every bite!

The cafe is pretty small with like 6 tables and a counter, but it was cozy and everything looked very new. The menus were really cute pink bound menus and the cups for water had the cute cat + logo on it. 

Drinks: 
Shizuoka Matcha Milk Foam - The matcha powder was definitely legit and the milk foam was soo good. The drink was just a little too sweet for my liking and I forgot to ask for less sugar.
Tiramisu Milk Foam - Milk foam was also good and there was a cute cat on the top of the foam in cocoa powder, but it was also a bit too sweet.

Snacks: 
Taiwanese Sausage Hamburger - We tried the sausage hamburger because I remember the rice sausage with Taiwanese sausage was one of my favorite Taiwan night market street foods. The ratio of rice sausage to Taiwanese sausage was pretty off though. The Taiwanese sausage that we got was so small and weirdly cut.

Overall, the cafe was pretty cute and they had a lot of classic Taiwanese snacks and dishes.

"momos-cafe-washington","""25/12/2018""",5,"We finally made it to this super cute cafe in DC. Being a lover of Instagram-worthy cafes and restaurants I was super excited to enter this little cafe with a beautiful flower wall waiting for us at the entrance. Upon entering, we saw a quaint and cozy little cafe that was perfect for spending an afternoon with friends or a date. I was already happy with what I saw but I was really looking forward to the food and drinks. 

The chef Lawrence kindly explained to us seasonal recommendations and also his aim to make authentic Taiwanese foods using fresh and natural ingredients. 

We ordered the Milk Foam Green Tea and the Ice Cream Cocoa. I loved the rich creamy layer of cheese foam that floated above a refreshing, slightly sweet green tea underneath. The Ice Cream Cocoa was also a new experience - kind  of like an affogato with hot chocolate and vanilla ice cream. It was warm, smooth, and creamy - perfect for a cold December day.

For entrees we got the Popcorn Chicken, Braised Pork on Rice, and Chicken Katsu Sandwiches. I loved the Popcorn Chicken for it's light, crispy batter that was savory with herbs and spices. The Braised Pork on Rice had a generous amount of pork and veggies with a perfectly runny egg and rice. The pork belly was so soft and tender it melted in my mouth! It was a nice balance of the crunchy vegetables and the nice, fatty pieces of pork belly. The Chicken Katsu came with large pieces of tender chicken covered in a teriyaki-style sauce, a fried egg and lettuce. I loved the house-made mayo that it came with. Overall the portions were large and the food came out fresh and made-to-order. 

Finally for dessert we got the Honey Toast which was a feast for the eyes and stomach! It was beautifully covered in green tea ice cream, house-made custard syrup, sprinkles, cookies, puffs, red bean, fresh strawberries, taro, mangoes and more! Also inside were squares of toast that were lightly fried. One dish was enough to feed 3-4 people. It was the perfect dessert because its such a good variety of different desserts in one that it will satisfy everyone's different tastebuds. 

All in all, it was a wonderful experience - impeccable service, clean and pleasing atmosphere, delicious food and drinks. We could really tell that they gave a lot of attention to detail and the owner and chef really care about each and every customer.","{""Friends"":0,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/hpFDpTge4eOE7qAR2uQNSQ/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Columbia, MD"",""Photos"":4,""Reviews_made"":1,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Ho9NOEVe9sK7L1mcyVIkqQ"",""Username"":""Travel M.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ClwR8nVMqh6_djAmcb0Kbg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kshMe315LiX3Qu_N9KFQ6g/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kwvKSW4LlKJhd-Mp370vwQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zvIQMX2rOcR4tNaNshAU0Q/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":2,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""I'm so happy you had a wonderful experience eating with us.

I ordered the macaroni and cheese and it was perfect! They use little shells for the noodles and it made it easy to eat. Topped with delicious buttery bread crumbs. I think it was white cheddar - nice and smooth and creamy. I would order this again for sure.

"lexus-of-portland-portland-3","""11/09/2017""",5,"I stumbled into this dealership in November 2016, which was right after I bought a 2007 ES 350 from a shady dealership following a horrific car accident in October. I eventually got justice for the all of the shady practices that the other dealership put me through. I'm happy to say that through it all, Kuni Lexus has stood by me and made that painful process a whole lot easier. My ES runs beautifully now. My service advisor, Brad, really helped me understand the process of servicing a car as well as providing some empathy when I bought the ES from that shady dealer. Several months later, I eventually pulled the trigger to buy my dream car: an RC 350 in Molten Pearl. Ironically enough, I ended up buying it from a Benz dealership down in Temecula because no one in Oregon had what I wanted for the right price and the features I specified. Regardless, I'm very thankful for the patience and professionalism that my salesman, Nick Feurey, exhibited throughout the test drives and other processes. When he went on vacation, I dealt with a condescending and rather rude salesman whose name I will keep confidential for the sake of discretion. I was very glad to work with Nick again before I ended up buying my car somewhere else. What stood out about Nick to me was that he didn't discriminate against me based on my age, which a lot of car salesman do no matter where I go. He treated me just as well as I imagined he would treat an older person with some serious cash. For that, I'm forever grateful. In any case, whether I bring my 2015 RC or my 2007 ES in for service, I definitely know that Kuni Lexus has got my back. Thank you for being an excellent dealership all around!","{""Friends"":128,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/6or6-Xt1jd1jXJgfEpNxEA/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""San Diego, CA"",""Photos"":41,""Reviews_made"":33,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=oWDp7Se0ggIxbImUbzhrdg"",""Username"":""Angelo S.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8IWfAIdxPKYlOE4EFCjrjQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/q0AOvW7fUkXgUMPMI_HVFA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/U7Gw2QygQViC2Por8t6MOQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VC-yX05THxS9ji4E3Sj2eA/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""Thank you so much for taking the time and allowing us to help you with this purchase!"",""Date"":""05/12/2016"",""Title"":""BizUserReviewReply"",""User_Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/buphoto/ET1351LqxR3dYRBf2QrX1Q/30s.jpg"",""Username"":""Kris G.""},{""Content"":""For the longest time, I've always been a firm believer that luxury vehicles were overrated and not worth the time and money to maintain. I've always been partial to Toyota because my parents have always bought Corollas and Camrys. My Uncle in SoCal is a Lexus fanatic and I never believed his Lexus cars were that much better until I recently purchased a 2007 Lexus ES 350 after totaling my Corolla. I bought this car from a different dealership in Portland and man, I've had nothing but problems with it and the dealer. Thankfully, I thought of taking it to both of the Lexus dealerships in Oregon. I got it all fixed up at Kuni Lexus of Portland and now it drives very well; it actually feels nicer to drive than my dad's new 2016 Toyota Camry! What I will say is that both Lexus dealerships in Oregon are excellent, but what stood out to me about Kuni Lexus was their killer combo of prompt/efficient/courteous customer service, luxurious waiting lounge complete with fancy coffee machine/snacks/Kuni-Lexus water bottles/fancy chocolate, and a more comprehensive used car inspection. The service team at Kuni actually found an issue that the other dealership didn't find that ended up saving me lots of money in the long run. They were also never pushy to get everything repaired, which stood out to me because I expected to get taken advantage of due to my lack of car knowledge. They were very transparent and honest about what really needed to be done on my car and what were just minor things that could be put off. My service advisor, Brad Dorshorst, went above and beyond to make sure I had my peace of mind about my less-than-perfect Lexus I bought from a shady dealer. He even contacted them with me to call them out for their business practices. It was a very valuable lesson in always getting your car inspected before buying and to also read up on return policies and the fine print on service contracts. I also had a great sales inquiry experience with Lana Tran. She was very prompt and professional with my questions. I also loved driving the 2017 ES 350 loaner car while my car was in the shop. I didn't want to give it back! It was so nice! It was such a treat after a horrible experience at the shady dealer I bought my car from. To top it off, Kuni Lexus even offered to replace my license plates for free with their own dealership plates just so I feel like I bought the car from them. It's true, you pay more for servicing your Lexus at the Lexus dealerships, but when you want the job done right coupled with excellent service, it's the way to go! I was so thankful and impressed with the level of service I received that I decided to put my culinary skills to use and baked up some bourbon whiskey-infused eggnog cupcakes for the staff! I'm so glad you all loved them! Thank you! All in all, my experience here was akin to a 5 star hotel experience (yes I've stayed at the Peninsula, New York Palace, Sutton Place, so I know what 5 star service is like.) If I do choose to buy a brand new Lexus car in the future in Oregon, it's a no-brainer: Kuni Lexus of Portland is the way to go!"",""Date"":""02/12/2016"",""Images"":[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/043dMnUj7nuRLgOaUcLEng/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/baJL_pmzxRFf4cnvOZtW_Q/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dQwNwNY9DTHSSM6DluaVsA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-pVPPsMyItbP8kziknhTXw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/LkPddaDQ2y36As-asQifbw/348s.jpg""],""User_Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/6or6-Xt1jd1jXJgfEpNxEA/60s.jpg"",""Username"":""Angelo S.""}]",106,"","0 check-in","Lexus of Portland",""

Hula boba was close by and had the makings of an interesting place, so I gave it a whirl. Literally it's like being a kid in an Asian themed candy shop... lots of Korean snacks, filipino snacks, and overall amazing items. But the best was the drink selections! 

I'm saw they had a drink called the ube monster, and I had to try it out. Got a ""small"" which definitely wasn't  small, with standard boba balls. It was good, had that sweetness you look for in ube, but wasn't as bright and vibrant as I hoped. Still, I go for the taste, not the IG pics. Still, I'd definitely return and check out some of the other options, as they had milk teas, healthy options, smoothies, and other things like that.

The only real downside was I was confused by the tape arrows on the floor, which I'm assuming are to help mitigate covid.

"la-cueva-cafe-taos","""31/12/2023""",4,"In two prior visits to Santa Fe, we didn't have any spare time for daytrips, but this fall we used the city as a base for a few of them.  One was to Taos because, well, it seems that everyone says that you need to visit Taos if you're in northern New Mexico.  

The approach to and setting of Taos is stunningly beautiful, but the central part of town sure wasn't in October 2023.  There was quite a bit of construction on both the main highway and in the plaza, and the traffic was horrible for a weekday in autumn.  To say the least, we were quite disappointed by what we saw in the center of town.  (The rest of the day--Taos Pueblo, the Rio Grande Gorge and bridge, etc.--was pretty great.)

But the modest La Cueva was a surprisingly good find.  Just a block off the plaza, it featured a basic Mexican lunch menu, but for very reasonable prices, the food was plated beautifully and was remarkably fresh-tasting.  The menu at lunchtime was quite limited, and and a chicken enchilada plate isn't exactly exciting, but this was easily better than I expected.  The wife had frito pie, which neither of us had ever tried.  That was excellent.

The little outdoor seating area in back was very pleasant in October, given that a line of crawling vehicle traffic was only a few dozen yards away, and the service couldn't have been much friendlier.","{""Friends"":168,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/lNPL8PAsMMh18e4BWzWM4g/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Cincinnati, OH"",""Photos"":167,""Reviews_made"":713,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=tjwblGkWN9m0vsGaypJ0Vw"",""Username"":""Ben N.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/TcNLgTaXTLYur-f3CDWz0w/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":2,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":2,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",6,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","La Cueva Cafe",""

"momos-cafe-washington","""18/03/2019""",4,"I made it in here after having it bookmarked for a few months now. I was excited to finally try something Asian and authentic in the city that's not too bougie nor whole-in-the-wall type as we have a good number of those in DC and especially Asian fusion type. After having tapas/small plates somewhere in Georgetown, my friends and I decided to stop by here for some dessert and tea. 

While I was really looking forward to being here, my party was immediately turned off by the $20+ price for the honey toast ... like whaaaaaa ??? I mean, we're used to seeing $10+ outside of DC and expected it to be just slightly more here at Momo's but nope. Our bad for initially looking at photos of the food and not of the menu. Also some of the big food items are very pricey. Luckily I mainly wanted dessert. 

Nonetheless my hubby and I ordered more than dessert. We shared the popcorn chicken. 'Twas soft and spicy. I probably would've finished it right away but I didn't have water to cool the spice and technically, it was supposed to be a for share appetizer. 

While waiting for our beef soup, my milk foam tea, my hubby's matcha latte, and our fried honey toast, the evening got busier. Service got a little slower but I was just happy to eventually by served water. 

One of my friends pointed out that Momo's focus is quality dishes and drinks. They lived up to the goal when we got our drinks. Seriously, that iced milk foam green tea was heavenly divine. I devoured it. And then the beef in the soup was unexpectedly super sooooffffttttt. I'm salivating again. Noodles were also thin which I personally love! Okay so as the hype built up, I anticipated one hell of a bomb toast. 

Initially when we were ordering I asked and received a more elaborate explanation between the honey toast and the fried honey toast. Basically it comes down to the preparation. The regular honey toast takes 30 mins to bake. The fried honey toast is about 15 mins deep fried. Both over $20. We ended up getting the fried honey toast and ... it was okay. Still good but overhyped.

I ordered the Braised Minced Pork on Rice and it was sooo good! I absolutely loved the taste of the pork belly and the sauce/marinade it was in, but it also had pickled mustard greens (I think?) that really added a great depth of flavor when I mixed the bowl together. There was also a fried egg on top, and as I always say, everything tastes better with a fried egg.

For drinks I got a strawberry black tea with jelly and that was so nice and refreshing! My friend got a milk tea with boba (I forgot which one) and let me have a sip and that was also really good. It wasn't refreshing like the strawberry black tea, but that's to be expected since it had milk in it. If I was in the mood for a milk tea today, I definitely would've gotten one here too though!

Me and my friends also got the popcorn chicken because  we wanted to share an appetizer and that was good as well! I am a big fan of Taiwanese style popcorn chicken and this definitely did not disappoint. I loved it on its own but also with the sweet chili sauce.

We also got the honey toast to share as well and wow!!!! Not only was it marvelous to look at, but it tasted great too. The toast was so crispy and wonderful-- and with the ice cream it was just the perfect contrast or hot & crispy with cold & creamy. It was amazing, but rare warning, it's very big!! We couldn't finish it as a group of three and we were so full at the end. It would probably be best for a group of 4-6 depending on how big your appetite is! One thing I also really enjoyed about the honey toast was that our server put these cute little snowmen and a tiny Christmas tree on our plate and it looked so festive! I even got to take a snowman home!

Speaking of the server, he was so great and attentive! He was so friendly to me and my friends and it was some of the best service I've ever gotten!

"momos-cafe-washington","""26/03/2019""",5,"I had my first honey toast about a year and ever since then I've been looking for places that make them. So far I only know of two in the area. Magnolia and Momo's Cafe.

Momo's Cafe opened up about six months ago in Georgetown. It's located on the first floor of a residential office complex.  Momo's Cafe focuses on Taiwanese cuisine. Like I said before I'm a big fan of honey toast, so once I heard they had it I had to come.  Additionally, I also tried the fries dumplings and popcorn shrimp as well as and a few of their drinks. Everything was extremely good. I definitely plan on coming back soon to some other items from the menu.

My food was brought out to me quickly and correctly and the restaurant itself is extremely clean.  I had the chance to meet the owner and he explained to me that these were the dishes he grew up on in Taiwan.  He was always very friendly and hospitable.

If you're looking for parking you there are a few options across the street. You can either park in the Safeway lot for two hours, but just make sure you purchase something from the supermarket. Your other option is the parking lot right behind the Safeway lot. It's metered and you can choose how long you want to stay for. I payed with Spot hero and it was $4.00 for three hours, which was more than enough time.","{""Friends"":109,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/wyx9LDx9ne6pBCxTNiDTtQ/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Washington, DC"",""Photos"":3460,""Reviews_made"":384,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=UvOcfMJOlwu-nE6IEspA-Q"",""Username"":""Robert A.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/YQbgWSOGaA0z9Qy3_YUItw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VZIfLh6NaHr4uga0IN4Z5g/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/x78mbtCPUWXv6eecylizgA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IIfHWjyHbKabMcpzcHBRQA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/D_iGR3BJVNMNUfpXkY2ZIg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/NrPakVqJOebyPRzbnosAFA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3wFYfNdSKLJkMEMsQ8g85Q/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""Robert, I know I already responded to your comments on our Google page, but I'd like to leave a response here as well.

"phnom-penh-cleveland","""20/07/2024""",3,"I visited for the first time in November 2023 with my friend Lesly. We came for dinner. I ordered the number 6 on the menu (Hue Beef Soup) which was listed then at a price of $8.99. I also ordered the spring rolls which were listed for $3.98 for two spring rolls. I also ordered hot tea ($2) which comes in a small cup but there is also a small tea kettle brought to the table which holds the rest of the tea.

FOOD -- This is a Cambodian and Vietnamese restaurant. There is lots to choose from on the menu. I would say that this is a simple/basic restaurant or average. The Hue Beef soup which is under $10 was the perfect dish for me because I was feeling slightly sick on that day so eating something hot helped my throat. I noticed that there was plenty of oil in the soup though which isn't the healthiest. The beef in the soup was tender which was nice. The spring rolls were good too. My friend also ordered the spring rolls and I think she also ordered the same soup as me and she enjoyed her meal.

I'd love to come back to try a rice dish but knowing that I love trying different restaurants around town, I know that I won't be back here anytime soon. This restaurant is very inexpensive and service was reasonable quick when I visited in November 2023 which is a plus.

"phnom-penh-cleveland","""01/02/2021""",4,"Never been to a Cambodian restaurant before and never thought my first time would be in CLE, but I was impressed by the wide selection of unique dishes with authentic flavors offered at this little gem on W 25th!  We stopped by for takeout, but they're open for eating in during COVID with a reasonably spacious indoor layout for relatively distanced dining. 

Since I'm not at all familiar with Cambodian dishes and didn't recognize most words on the menu, we ended up just getting two of their most popular items, the Chha Kreoung Ma Rass Prowt (a deliciously aromatic stir fry with your choice of proteins tossed with turmeric, garlic, lemongrass and lime leaves, served in a very sweet peanut sauce) and the Amok Siemreap. Both dishes were absolutely bursting with flavor but we both preferred the latter, which was an indulgent seafood amalgamation of shrimp, scallops, imitation crab (not crab) and steamed fish cooked in creamy coconut milk and wrapped in fragrant banana leaf. ** Highly recommend ordering your food at least medium spicy to take that flavor explosion to the next level. 

Kind of underwhelming portion sizes for the price but otherwise an overall impressive takeout experience with phnom-enal phlavors that was a very pleasant intro into the world of Cambodian cuisine :^) Already looking forward to my next visit!","{""Friends"":400,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/WT7oRjKnC3F6LaxJZL6JrQ/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Sacramento, CA"",""Photos"":878,""Reviews_made"":173,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=6eE1uVdsj-d3_ABwoeJKGg"",""Username"":""Leslie H.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OFhgKguKzpGmwwHU0tXG6A/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":22,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":25,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",2,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","Phnom Penh",""

"hula-boba-kapolei-kapolei","""26/02/2021""",5,"The thing I like about Hula Boba that I think no other boba shop does/has is that you get to choose however many toppings you want for FREE up until a certain point (the 1st line, see picture).

My bf got the tiger milk tea, which is half Thai tea and half black tea with boba. The two together is a pretty good blend. Thai tea was not too strong, which is good since I don't like Thai tea.

I got the mango strawberry smoothie with strawberry pops, lychee jelly, coconut jelly, mango jelly, & boba (yay!). I taste more mango than strawberry.

For my main course, I opted to split a vegetarian burger and salad with my friend, and the staff happily accommodated us! The burger comes with a generous portion of fries.

I'm used to street tacos but this was quite different. The double corn taco was a combination of soft and crisp which was delish, but the real standout was the beef! The taco was studded quite full with a sliced brisket type beef. Fantastic!!the chicken enchilada was my hubby's fav. Again stuffed with a lot of white meat chicken which was not smothered in a sauce, but instead just tender and yummy. The green enchilada sauce and melted cheese was pretty heavenly. And then the relleno. I love them anyway, and this was large, tender, cheesy, with a light batter. Even the beans and the rice were especially tasty.

What I don't like (but seems to be the thing in New Mexico), is paying for chips and salsa to start the meal. We should have passed on it anyway, but didn't...I also was not fond of my hubby's ""traditional margarita made with wine"". It was definitely not at all traditional tasting, instead it tasted like a sour mix, instead if from fresh limes. 

We didn't get desert, but from prior experience (about 6 years ago) their flan and chocolate cake were is both good, but the Key lime pie (not on menu but offered on special times of the year is OUTSTANDING. (This wasn't one of this times, evidently, or we'd have made room for pie!

PS The other times we came was in early summer when sitting out back was delightful. As it's quite cold on these fall evenings, we sat inside.

Tucked away in the corner of Georgetown, Momo's Cafe is a Taiwanese restaurant focusing on milk teas and street food delights.

They want all their flavors to stay authentic and I definitely tasted it. I tried 3 of their bubble teas and it was the best I've ever had in the DMV. Not overly sweet with quality tea flavor you can taste. They also have honey toast which was better than Magnolia (YEAH I SAID IT) because the toast actually had toasted flavor which complimented the toppings very well. Taiwanese popcorn chicken was nicely seasoned and tasted very authentic. We had their steak and eggs sizzling on a skillet which was fun to see.

It's soooo good and you don't feel guilty because it's not as expensive as some of the other items on the menu.  I also tried their potted plant drink. I had always wanted to try these drinks you see on Instagram.  Now I can check it off my list of things to try!

The fish sauce and noodles was quite good, unfortunately the beef wasn't that good. I was quite disappointed. This is family owned business, there was unfortunately one person as the waiter so it was a slow service, however he was very kind when he got to our table. The food did take some time to come out(I think there was only one person in the kitchen), unfortunately it was not worth the wait. It was very mediocre Cambodian cuisine. The mango tea was also lacking flavor. There was a certain flavor lacking in these dishes that I would expect from Khmer cooking. Ultimately I was disappointed here, but if you want to try Cambodian cuisine, it's an introduction to the cuisine and culture.

"pep-boys-la-mirada-5","""14/10/2021""",1,"Back on 9/26/2021 I visited Pep Boys tire shop on Rosecrans and Valley View in the city of La Mirada

I needed 2 tires replaced for my 2019 Mini Cooper. My tires were run flats but really only one had been blown but they had that buy 3 get 1 free deal so I ended up replacing all 4 tires.

The tech had told me he couldn't install new tire sensors that work with my Mini. So I ended up taking my car to the dealer, Crevier Mini on October 5th and to my disbelief they found two TPMs missing and another two damaged.

This damage was done by Pep Boys. So not only did I pay $535 for the tires but because of the negligence of their  tech I now had to pay another $653 to fix the issue Pep Boys caused.

I am seeking compensation for the full amount I paid at Crevier due to Pep Boy's negligence, for $653.76. I am not asking for compensation for my time taking out of work to drive 60 miles across 2 days to fix the problem caused by their mechanics for the time being but I have tried to contact them multiple times and I feel they are ignoring me.","{""Friends"":12,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/Bk3ofUnhPMM0tNeEilyylA/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""McKinney, TX"",""Photos"":234,""Reviews_made"":74,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=6BA7fU4pspFEaNKN9paX1A"",""Username"":""Orlando A.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/h5GBfQP4GOzxfJbrn7t4Hg/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":2,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""Hi Orlando !

Even i told him all my friends said its fixable, he still kept saying its not...i need to replace a new one. Also, said its a new policy that he cannot fix it here. That pissed me off!!! 

Was it because im a girl, you think girls are stupid & know nothing about the car? That was why you tried to rip me off? Then, i said its okay, i will take to somewhere else. What a bad experience!!!

1) Phone call first to verify operating hours (because of Covid)
2) Question whether they can do a chassis lube ( because Dillingham location  lube gun was broken) Here's my story:

Since Dillingham could not accommodate me and I wanted to shop out on the West side anyway I called the Aiea location and asked if they do chassis lube. The phone conversation said ""No they don't.... I don't know what you're asking me...."" I chose to stop over anyway simply because I was in the the area.  Short story is Manager comes over and argues with me about the semantics and definition of a chassis lube... Worker tries to get information from me saying I am not in their data base (even if I know I am and get emails from them regularly) I tried to explain ""pointing at the sticker I got from my previous visit to Jiffy Lube...""  I left....  after visiting TWO Jiffy Lubes 
... very upset at the process...

Hula Boba should be the 'go-to' for those who have a dying urge for boba, but don't wanna spend more than $10 each (like at Infinitea). Here, you not only have a wide range of delicious drinks and smoothies to choose from, but they also include up to 3 toppings per drink for $5.50 for a small and $6.00 for a large.

It tastes like a Melona bar. It's creamy and milky. I loved it

The banana Mochi was our for sample and I found that a little too sweet for my buds.  They had these big roll seaweed that I Awwwwed over.  I bought the basic flavor, they have BBQ and a few other flavors, but the original flavor was perfect! It's a roll of crispy nori and wow, it makes a great snack!

For entrées, we ordered the chicken Molé fajitas and the two taco plate (1 beef and 1 chicken).  The chicken taco was a little plain, but the beef taco was delicious with a wonderful depth of flavor.  The real star of the was the chicken Molé fajitas (1 of 2 daily specials).  The grilled vegetables (green and red peppers and onion) mixed with the chicken breast and the Molé sauce had that wonderful chocolate flavor you expect from Molé.  30 minutes later we were still talking about the dish.

"silver-diner-woodbridge-4","""31/08/2014""",4,"Dropped by at 8 a.m. for breakfast before beginning our errands on a Sunday and it wasn't too busy.

We have been here now about five times at different hours of the day and can honestly say that this place is a 4.5 star place. I withhold the .5 because of service. Two of the times that we were here the service was a full five stars! All of the other times service was mediocre at best. Really wish that the place was more overstaffed, especially during the rush, as opposed to being understaffed. Sometimes the coffee cup sits empty, or the Tabasco doesn't arrive until half way during the meal, or napkins never arrive, or something else is missing, or the silverware is dirty and needs replacing, etc. service needs to be better, especially because the prices are on the higher end for breakfast. 

Onto the food! The food here is always amazing! The quality does not get any better. This morning we had the country scramble with oatmeal instead of the strawberry bowl and wheat toast instead of pancakes and the pancakes with blueberries, breakfast ham, and scrambled eggs.

The country scramble had way too much moisture for me, I would've preferred it to be dry so that I could get a little crunch out of the potatoes. That's just me.

The blueberry pancakes were delicious and so was the ham. The ham was very tasty and way less salty compared to country ham. Good stuff!

The wheat toast is a must! All the grains...it's so good. We always get toast, whether it comes with the meal, substitute for it, or order a side of it--it's pretty food.

We arrived for a very late breakfast at 3 p.m. on a Sunday. Our waitress was Kathryn and she deserved every bit of her 15 percent tip!\n\nWe had the farm raised bison huevos rancheros, pesto burger with bison, wasabi fresh Atlantic salmon sliders, apple pie a la mode, with a lemonade and an orange juice.\n\nKathryn must have visited our table at least ten times during the hour that we were there. She was patient and cheerful, and a real pleasure to have around.\n\nThe huevos rancheros was delicious, with a bit too much goat cheese for my taste, otherwise just delightful. It came with three large pieces of multigrain tortillas and that turned out to be more than enough. This was very filling and not greasy at all, other than the oil from the chorizo itself, the whole mix was not smothered with oil. Just great!\n\nThe pesto burger was loaded with flavor and prepared very well. Pesto always compliments perfectly and it was ever present in this dish. We chose to have this meal with sweet potato fries and even the fries were perfect. We order sweet potato fries whenever they're on the menu and they're always greasy and usually have a pool of oil underneath the stack. Not here! These were perfect!\n\nThe salmon sliders were tasty but the salmon was a little drier than we prefer, also, the salmon was too thin in relation to the buns, so it tasted more of bread than of salmon. The teriyaki sauce was delicious, packed with yumminess, and enhanced the flavor overall. I do not like teriyaki because it's too sweet but this was ideal sweetness. The wasabi could've been amplified though, it was more of a muted taste. The ginger was nice little treat. Taste of the whole thing all together was flavorful, just too much bread. This came with a little spinach salad with some fruits in a sweet dressing.\n\nThe apple pie a la mode was delicious. Kathryn asked if we wanted it warmed up and that made it even better! It tasted fresh and homemade--you know how an unsifted ball of salt makes its way in every now and then? They were present here too. The dough was nice and moist and the ice cream was great.\n\nIn conclusion, Kathryn redeemed Silver Diner compared to our previous experience. Our first time here was five stars, second time was three, and this our third time was five again! Quality and taste of the food is always a five! Service though really contributes to our overall enjoyment.\n\nHighly recommended!!\n\n$70"",""Date"":""25/08/2014"",""Images"":[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dQvWGhV8Mp7YIf201IhPIw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/J57VBNLcyJ_JGFqFO0tLqw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/N0ERNJcwvQLXw8YIS2soOA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ei6sElvg11T4Tt6a6hJZSQ/348s.jpg""],""User_Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/Alz-QpLTytJU9nTbLx-_sw/60s.jpg"",""Username"":""Alison E.""},{""Content"":""My last review for this restaurant was five stars but this trip receives only three because our waiter was horrible.

"the-regency-tower-syracuse","""27/02/2018""",5,"This apartment is a 60s-style apartment in the historic Hawley-Green district (known to be LGBT-friendly). It's a great option if you want to live close enough to downtown without paying the high prices of a downtown spot. Mention my name if you decide on getting an apartment here! The staff may have discounts for you! Don't look over this place! This place is a 15minute walk to downtown and Clinton Square. It is very peaceful and close to downtown. Across the street is a Korean restaurant. A 1-bedroom (non-updated) is $930 a month. This is a great deal because the space is huge! A one bedroom here is almost 1,000 square feet and there is a ton of closet space (one hallway closet, one entrance closet, one walk-in closet in the bedroom and a non-walk-in closet in the bedroom AKA his/hers). The living room is huge and the master bedroom is more than enough space for a king sized bed with a couch. What you won't find out about this place online is that this place has amazing views of the city! If you face south, you will see views of the sunset and the Dome/city. If you face north, you'll see views of the sunrise and the lake. The higher the floor, the more amazing the views become. At night, you can see the city sparkle. On top of the great price, utilities are FREE. This includes cable TV, electricity (heat, AC), gas, and water. All the kitchens also have gas stoves. All the units have enclosed balconies (with some charming brick) that help keep the heat in but also make beautiful spots to lounge-in during the summer. One of the best parts about this place is that you can get guaranteed indoor heated garage parking. It's $55/car for self-park or a little more if you want valet-parking (where an attendant parks your car for you). This place has a lot of older folks so it's very peaceful. The walls are thick and made of steel so you do not hear your neighbors. Each floor has it's own laundry machine and floor tenants are assigned 3-hour slots twice a week (you get to pick which slot you want) so no one can hog the machine during your time. If you don't want to do that, there is also a laundry room in the basement open 24-7 for anyone. There is also a free gym downstairs, a hair salon (appointments only) and an Italian restaurant attached to the downstairs lobby area of this place. There is a 24/7 doorman and staff. Your packages are safe here when delivered and guests need to be seen by the doorman before they are allowed to enter the building (they give you a call and confirm if you want them let in). It makes it feel super safe. This place is quirky because each unit looks a little different.  You can get carpet or parque wood flooring depending on your liking. Some units are updated (and will cost more) and have a different layout. Staff here are super friendly. They even have a grocery delivery bus that comes twice a week that takes you to the grocery store. They even have a car-washing service in the heated garage. The heated garage is attached to the basement so you never have to bare the harsh winter to go in and out of your unit and carry-in groceries. They even have roller grocery carts you can borrow to bring stuff from your car to your unit. Each floor also has a recycling room and trash chute so you don't have to go far to throw away trash. They also allow cats/dogs (additional fee). Each floor also has a mail chute so you can send envelops/mail without having to go downstairs to the mailbox. Repairmen are also super friendly and prompt about fixing things. The kitchen has a cool pegboard where you can hang stuff (Julia Child style!). They have a vending machine downstairs too so you can get midnight snacks/drinks. They also have a give-a-book-take-a-book shelf where people can peruse and take others' unwanted books.","{""Friends"":1638,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/wpGLwRZWe8xlxm1CX8e1xQ/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Rancho Palos Verdes, CA"",""Photos"":9821,""Reviews_made"":4186,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=I9vkjKs1O5Ctf5gy0ry4yg"",""Username"":""Brenda L.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9fDkgIwXKqZRL8d8BVCpFw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2x4TV9qMMul50SCoi6SFTg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2dEd6Hm9BLu5OoPQRxVPuw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/H5yhtMnXAENFNERAYFPJ6g/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/O4ADh-YJt6fU8BvsWBu9Ww/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xGx3Q1sl_v7i-gLjGhjvBA/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":7,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":3,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",2,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","The Regency Tower",""

Atmosphere- This place is a combo restaurant and convenience store which is common in this county.  The store side has mostly Hispanic products but of course everyone is welcome. As a Gringo I felt completely at home here.

The place is spotless, and you can sit at tables in the store area as I did or there is a somewhat secluded separate room with a little more privacy. If you look at my pic, the entrance to the separate room is in the background. 

Customer Service- My server was the owner, Raul, and he was wonderfully engaging.  You can tell he cares a great deal about pleasing his customers.  My service was excellent.

Adult Libations- These folks have a beer & wine license with a basic selection of each. I had an ice cold Modelo which got the job done.

Food- This is your standard Mexican menu with a few American items thrown in which is typical.  As you peruse the menu there will be no surprises.

I hadn't had a Chimichanga for a while, so I ordered the ground beef platter version for about ten bucks.

The food was out in good time with standard plating.  The Chimi was massive as you can see in my pics.  I found every item fresh and flavorful but mild.  I would have appreciated a bottle of hot sauce on the table. Raul, did you hear that?  Overall my food was great, and I was stuffed.

I see these folks are open for breakfast and that's what I'm going to try next.","{""Friends"":4758,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/wjRWjAS6UePDwCcJIKK2aA/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Orlando, FL"",""Photos"":1756,""Reviews_made"":1454,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Oi1qbcz2m2SnwUeztGYcnQ"",""Username"":""Steven B.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/68gjObDOsJlEKmJWv450JA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZLFBX8pqPmMk7yp_enMpLw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/annrlzJDX6yHiEjXXCRB2A/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":28,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":21,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",5,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","La Hacienda Restaurant",""

This time made a reservation so we were seated right away, on the side - away from the bar area so a more roomy area with fewer tables around - good on a cloudy day since there is no cover here.  Service was very prompt, and they leave a water bottle on the table which is preferred.  We had the Waterman's platter and crispy fish sandwich, both very good, with excellent crispy batter - the oysters were super tasty (considering I don't usually like oysters - now am a convert), the sandwich however could use a bit less sauce as it soaked the bottom bun too much making it hard to pick up.

If I remember correctly, you and your friends started at the outside bar, but moved inside when it started to rain. Things were of course a little chaotic for the moment since we had a lot of guests moving seats and transferring tabs. Your food had just come out when you moved, so when you asked for the fries, the bartender did actually ring them in, but they went to your previous seat and some lucky guest got some free fries. I'm sure he seemed annoyed to you, but he was honestly just stressed about the sudden rush of guests and trying very hard to keep up with everyone. \n\nYour experience may not have been the greatest, but I do hope you can understand that there were some extenuating circumstances. I'd love to invite you back, maybe on a sunny day, and change your opinion of us. Please contact me directly if you're interested.

"the-salt-line-washington","""06/07/2021""",4,"I went here with friends for dinner Monday night since it was a holiday. Let's get the cons out of the way so we can move on to pros

CONS: the ordering process!! you need to utilize your phone to order and immediately pay for everything you want. When I arrive my phone battery was super low and died prior to me being able to place my order. So I had to have one of my friends place my order for me. SECOND-- once you place your order on your phone you must immediately pay for your order (also including tip, if you choose) for it to be processed and brought to your table. The issue I have with this is that my tip is usually based on the service I get which is usually determine at the end of your meal. Second if there is an issue how do they correct your check if you've already paid for it before you've even received it. I think they should switch to those mini ordering kiosks at each table which tracks your order and gives you plenty of options to complete payment once you're ready to close your check. I also wondered what happened if you are one of those people that just doesn't have a phone or a phone not updated enough to utilize QR codes like your grandma's and grandpa's. I did ask if I was able to just place my order with the server and he said ""no, all orders must be placed through your phone""

PROS: they had a great selection of meal items to choose from on the menu. The server was super helpful and answered all of our questions and we had plenty, with it being our first time dining at The Salt Line. Once you placed your order on your phone the orders came out quickly and efficiently they looked and tasted amazing. We had the Kampachi Crudo, Stuffies, Seared Scallops, & Crispy Skin Rockfish accompanied by Dirty Martinis. We had a great time with no complaints. I would recommend and hope they make the ordering updates.","{""Friends"":0,""Location"":""San Francisco, CA"",""Photos"":21,""Reviews_made"":5,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=OF5q3LtjclNZfX4nGtY03Q"",""Username"":""Gee W.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7lNOskUvjRdB0jMXlm6_2A/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gwApBSJDF3am0Z1orjzDIw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4_jUceAbM9A6rKJyOAbMZg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bJTKyvwDvlL5AtlxVi8ioA/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""Hello Gee,\nThanks for your visit and your feedback. Glad you overall enjoyed but are sorry for the complications that arose from the ordering system. Sounds like those issues could certainly have been avoided with some better communication on our part. For one, if you were having issues, then the server in area should have been able to just take your order and put in for you- sorry that didn’t happen. Also for the record, the system does not require you to close out after each order and is designed so that you put in credit card info to start tab just like you would at a bar then the payment and tip is not actually processed until end when you complete payment. Additionally, it is very easy for adjustments or corrections to be made to your check at any time through the process if anything does need to be corrected. \n\nWe also do always have full service dining option in our inside and outdoor dining areas so we can always look to get people seated there who are looking for the more traditional service experience. \n\nHopefully you’ll be back as it does sound that ordering issues aside you did enjoy the restaurant so please feel free to email me directly at brian@thesaltline.com and I’ll see to it that we get you set up comfortably and deliver a more seamless service experience for you.

First choose your size. Fill your cup with custard, herbal jelly, boba, and/or gels of various flavors!  It's free up to the first line of the cup. If you want more, there's a small upcharge. 

I got the Lychee Green Tea with coconut gel, mango gel in the shape of stars, and square shaped brown sugar gel. I liked the colors and flavors...but MOST of all, 
I got my CUTE PENGUIN CUP!!!

Here is what is new:
You can self serve yourself with your favorite add ons! You want jelly? Boba? Both with diferent flavors? Do it!  The kids will also love pouring their own too. I know mine do.

Now when I need my quick fix I got it!\n\nThey have so much variety and  flavors to choose from!  I've actually been going there since they had a very soft opening.  Before the grand opening happened the lady at the counter already started remembering me (and my motley crue of yoyo kids behind me) \n\nI love their milk tea, iced not blended! BUT you can have it blended and also control the sweetness level.  The have snow ice, smoothies and even green tea boba.\n\nThe shop has samples of some products and a whole bunch of Asian brand snacks that I haven't seen in a LOOONG time!  Are you looking for KitKat from Japan? Asparagus stick biscuits? Those yummy snacks filled with chocolate of all flavors? Well They have all that and more.  I bought my share of asparagus biscuits because they are fabulously good with nutella! \n\nCustomer service is always excellent!  We went to the grand opening and they were giving free milk tea to the first 100 customers. Let me tell you, they were so efficient that the line went so quick.  It really showed how they could handle a mass load of customers. \n\nLately the lines have been growing, but don't get discouraged.

Luckily, we decided on Hale Mahina, B304 was perfect for us and the beach was still literally a 2 minute walk and right behind the pool.

The best thing was the fantastic view, we went to the beach at least once a day and saw sea turtles in the sand every time we went later in the afternoon. My wife and I spent every night lounging on the balcony enjoying the beach smell and sounds after we put the kids down.

Another good thing to as proximity, very close to convenient places to eat, get groceries, and get gas. It was also a close drive to the more seculded north end of the island and all the tours and excursions south in Lahaina.

They dub themselves Sacramento's only urban winery, a trend that I think many more wineries need to get in on. But for the time being, I will thoroughly enjoy what Revolution has to offer.

They offer both indoor and outdoor seating, with a patio adjacent to Temple Coffee shop. It was a beautiful evening when we went so we enjoyed sitting outside on the patio under the twinkling lights. Our server was both attentive and knowledgeable as well as friendly and engaging. (So much so that she convinced me to join their wine club.) 

We were not super hungry so we shared one of the Chef's Plates with three different meats and an order of baked brie. Both were absolutely divine and served with the perfect accompaniments. As for the wine, I thoroughly enjoyed their selection of both red and whites. We ended up leaving with a growler of one of the red wines that is currently on sale for Earth Day.

If this were a game of cards, the hand that Momo's dealt me would have been a Royal Crush. 

From the moment my eyes locked on their beautiful drinks and delicate desserts, I knew a visit was a necessity in the near future. And although I was unable to attend the Yelp event here, I was determined to make the visit sooner than later.

Luckily, when I dropped by there were no lines. No crowds. I had just grabbed some sushi next door, so unfortunately did not bring my appetite. However, I'll be sure to do so for next time since their savory food items looked and smelled so good!

Since I'm a sucker for visual candy from the 'gram, I had already been intrigued and curious about the Potted Plant Milk Tea. Although, I figured that I probably couldn't go to wrong, I was a little worried that a drink that gimmicky might not actually taste that good.

Not was I wrong. It was so good. The Oreo Cookie crumbles sat atop and once I broke the service with my SHOVEL SPOON (yes, another highlight) it was evident how nicely the crisp crumbles complimented the mildly sweet milk tea. I actually really loved it. 

Also, everything is so cute here. From the patio seating with IG worthy back drop, to the little accents in the shop, I loved it all. Plus, the young woman that helped me decide what to order was so incredibly nice (and was not at all judgmental about simultaneously indecisive and excited I was!)

Even though I don't live terribly close, I'm going to make sure I work Momo's into my rotation whenever I'm on Georgetown or driving through The Palisades.

Can't wait to return to try some other delicious drinks!","{""Friends"":3770,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/umaAkyv-dTLEIEJk8-MJRQ/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Washington, DC"",""Photos"":3671,""Reviews_made"":1089,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=qI3uzegMdq3q3WxAajECGw"",""Username"":""Tara L.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Bjy4QRiR7TKGMTCf7-5eGw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/l0VOIBM4CZj1WbbHOymQQQ/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":18,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":14,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""Your determination and anticipation to come pay us a visit sounds like it paid off, Tara!

"momos-cafe-washington","""08/03/2019""",4,"I had the day off so I decided to come here for lunch after running errands all around DC. Since it's kind of across town from me,  I wanted to make sure I tried a variety of things while I was there. I walked in and was greeted and seated immediately. Since it was the middle of the work day it was only me and one other table. 

I ordered the milk tea. I wanted to try their tiramisu foam tea but unfortunately they were out :(. The regular Moma milk tea was really good though. The boba tapioca balls were delicious! Some of the best I've had. Although a simple drink, it was definitely worth it. I'd say it's an oldie but goodie. For appetizer, I got the popcorn chicken. They were so flavorful! And the cooked basil pieces were a delicious addition! For my entree, I got the minced pork. I LOVED it.  The pork was fatty (as it should be. I'm Puerto Rican, so cooked fatty pieces of pork is something I grew up with as well) . It comes with an over easy egg on topic which added a decadence to the dish. It also came with pickles and broccoli, but honestly, I paid no mind to them. I was loving the pork, rice, egg and yolk too much. 

The service was good. There was only one girl working. I was kind of indecisive and she was patient with me. It was really cold inside, and i was borderline freezing while drinking my milk tea. So once the other table left I mentioned something and she immediately raised the heat. After, it was perfect temp. And i appreciate her immediately raising the heat for me. 

The place is small. Luckily since it was midday I had no issue.  Two critiques though, the popcorn chicken came out way too hot. I couldn't even bite into one without it burning my mouth.  While i understand it was cooked immediately, I think it was just way too hot to be served so quickly (or without an FYI).  Second, although what I ordered wasn't too pricey, a lot of the things on the menu were pretty expensive for what you'd expect at a small cafe. 

Overall, I had a real good experience. I think the food is delicious. And although some were too pricey, the mince pork I found appropriately priced for the amount and deliciousness of the dish.

I went as a party of two and we ordered the Chicken Katsu sandwich, Taiwanese Rice Sausage, and a daily stewed fish special. The katsu was actually a grilled chicken and was not fried or had any breading. It was very flavorful but a bit on the saltier side. The rice sausage was really good and recommend it if you've never tried it before. There are also pickles and garlic, which was awesome as it was how I ate it growing up, and there plenty of pieces for sharing. Finally the stewed fish was really good and had nice pieces of potatoes as well. All the entrees have enough food for one person but they are totally shareable, too.

-Poor Customer Service (Pushy, Slow, and Inattentive)
-Bad Food (My Burger was burnt)
-NOT Diner-Like food, more Restaurant-Like (Very ""Exotic"" for Diner Food)
-Not Recommended trying this place 

Full Review:
I am very conflicted on what Silver Diner is trying to pass off as, these days. I haven't been here since there was a gravel lot behind the restaurant for overflow parking. Not much has changed here except for a new Menu with high prices. The building is the same and still pulls off a great Diner vibe. What threw me off was the Menu. I was expecting simple breakfast creations and simple dinner meals (for example simple burgers, soups, and home meals). What I found out was everything from Goat Cheese Milkshakes to Salmon Slider to, what I got, Pesto Burgers. In addition to that surprise, the prices were outrageously expensive. It took about 15 minutes for a waiter to show up and take my group and my drink orders. After ordering, it took a oddly long amount of time to get our food. While we were waiting, everyone's drinks were out, but the waiter didn't offer to refill them until after a couple of side salads were served. Once we received our food, the waiter failed to removed the empty plates, which made the table cramped. My Pesto Burger was not good at all. It was burnt, just like another person at my table, who ordered a burger, and my burger got weirdly crunchy at the end of the burger. The waiter only came by the table once before asking for deserts after we were done eating. The deserts were not Diner-Like and were more Restaurant-Like. Again the prices were expensive (Around $7 for a Milkshake). This was where we cut the line and went to somewhere cheaper for deserts. The waiter offered the check and didn't take any finished dishes. For a group of four people with four meals and four drinks totaled us to about $65 without a tip included. That isn't a diner price. I find it hard to call this place Silver Diner. It was more like Silver Dollar. I wouldn't recommend going to this place. There are many better competition out there.","{""Friends"":1,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/c31iy0ZSYihmszwwWmY_AQ/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Lake Ridge, VA"",""Photos"":3078,""Reviews_made"":316,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=fuN7dnYNUARKO4PU4XzR0A"",""Username"":""Gr8vette G.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6ydof-AC1RNUHaLxzVzm5g/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KWViN-XBzT6VLWHl0a28Fg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mMOButSlZKaMFp3jYKt7MA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VhLHzyf7zTOEEQ3Lno9SaQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/R-uuceVuyH5W9K2wfEDYWQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/rIlylOodz_O_HIwkKi9Aaw/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":2,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""Gr8vette, thanks for your review.

Upon walking in, the store is small but I was surprised they had so many snacks and different ramen bowls. I wanted to walk around but before anyone else comes in and a line starts to form, I decided to order first and then look while I waited. 

Got my usual iced lychee with black tea. I needed a lil more caffeine this morning. 

While waiting I got a chance to look around a little bit. All Asian snack bags. I looked out the window across the street and wondered how busy this place would get during lunch since the office building with several call centers is right across the way. They also have the different Japanese Kit Kat flavors which I still don't get why the USA doesn't have these mainstream!!??  Even saw that they sell the toppings in case you wanna make your own iced/milk tea drinks at home. Could help myself, I poked at it to check it's consistency and it was soft indicating it was still fresh??

Within a matter of minutes my order was up with a simple explanation that the bag of tempura mushroom snacks was complimentary. What!!?? Complimentary means free. As soon as I grabbed my items, they put up another free snack bag for the next order. 

Before I left, o asked what time they opened because I would love to come in first trying in the morning for a caffeine drink, but they open at 11. 

Needless to say, I'll be back because of the well organized store, quick friendly service, easy parking, reasonable price and snacks for days.

TL;DR: Cute presentation but average bubble tea, smoothies are better. GET THE TURTLE CHIPS. Boba is good and drink prices are pretty reasonable! The convenience store snack prices are extremely reasonable!

FYI: There is signage stating that the Boba is made fresh daily and can take up to an hour -- good things come to those who wait! The boba is very tender with a slight chew -- the best kind!

Parking: private lot.

Atmosphere: it's a mini convenience store for light snacks, sweets, and of course boba tea!

Menu: posted on the exterior windows, on the back wall behind the register, and in case you missed it, right in front of you when you order!

Service: I recommend grabbing the snacks you want first and paying for them and your drink at the same time. There is minimal wait time for your drink -- they are fast! When you order, you can customize sweetness level and ice level -- the fruit teas tend to be sweeter than the smoothies.

The Fruit Teas and slush are average in my opinion. If you get something here, go wild and get something you wouldn't normally find at any other bubble tea joint. 

The smoothies here are pretty dang good. I recommend the Tiger Milk Smoothie!

You can get a ""Thai Wall"" added to your drink for an additional charge. It is a layer of condensed milk added to line the inner walls of your drink cup.

Turtle Chips: Oh my god. I have found a new favorite snack! There's a reason they are at the front of the store. I love the flavor of these chips and they taste exactly like seasoned sweet corn but in chip form! I bought one bag to try and then went back in and bought 3 more!

The small is a whopping 24oz and the large is 33oz. The Keiki is your standard cup of boba at most spots at 16oz. 

We got the Tiger Milk Tea (thai + signature) with Almond pudding and Lavender Milk Tea with custard pudding and grass jelly. The Lavender actually tasted like a milky lavender (you'd be surprised how many spots don't follow through on the lavender part). The Tiger Milk Tea didn't have a super strong thai taste but the tea was prominent. The Almond Pudding kinda overpowered this drink so I'd suggest getting this only if you love the almond flavor.","{""Friends"":144,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/T1cwmuG1bYGBNxR98OrNiQ/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Honolulu, HI"",""Photos"":9699,""Reviews_made"":778,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=r5vH6StCHEPsy0BjJ27EPw"",""Username"":""Corina Q.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wsshkFLpP4OYc39azer4OQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/b73rP62GG3pt1rcBtVuvKw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_JZpR0RU677WNbEwS3rJIw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/INyqjJKtReU4euyAVF88CA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/p3KyK4ZKR5RlbqwC_Ejf8g/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1TUym86Li5YnPloChCNSng/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/D-tm3lEIiz5WSsR3kXDqQg/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":7,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":2,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",3,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","Hula Boba Kapolei",""

It's absolutely different for sure...is it a Boba or snack place? and the cups I'm so glad I bought this cup holder that holds various sizes cause these cups are  super adorable but they're like buckets that they call sumo cups lol!!

As this is my first time here and as it's original concept was a self serve drink that obviously changed due to covid I'm not used to the ordering system.  Their menu is huge and very personalized you can choose your tea and flavors, sweetness and toppings which I wasn't sure because it wasn't listed on the menu but decided on iced tea with boba.  At first the boba was yummy but started to clump together and got gummy, maybe I was drinking too slow but was driving so I guess it was too hot?

Super quick and friendly staff and am excited to try something new, it was so refreshing and totally recommend.

Follow the self serve directions and select what you want in your cup. Hand it over to the worker and pick your flavor and in a few minutes, presto you get your drink!

Hint: My friend wanted azuki beans and didn't see it  on the self serve line, but asked if they did and sure enough had it. Got to add the scrumptious red beans in as well. They have a frequent visitor stamp card if you are into doing that to earn a free drink.

What was cool is that with the purchase of a drink they gave a free candy pack with your order. Nothing too fancy, but certainly a nice touch. Service was friendly and helpful.

We ordered the chocolate Oreo smoothie with pineapple chunks, passion fruit popped jelly, strawberry smoothie, and lavender milk tea with custard, lychee custard, and lychee popping jelly. The lavender tea was yummy and all the toppings tasted great with the tea. The size of the cups are wider and are super cute.

"rowdy-hair-phoenix","""07/03/2019""",1,"I previously gave this salon a good rating, and I have been to this stylist a few times before, but this time she messaged me in the morning letting me know she had a bug and wanted to let me know in case I did not want to bring it home to my kids. No I do NOT care, I have 2 young kids and this is mommy's hair day. At this point I hadn't had my ombré done in a year or a cut in almost 6 months (it just has not worked out for the last year with my infant and work). I told her I did not care, she said ok, then later tried to see if I wanted to do it this weekend, but I work. I told her I didn't mind calling to see if another stylist could take me the next day because if I didn't do it one of those 2 days I would not have a day again for a while. So she told me to come in. We talked about what I wanted, I said I wanted it to be pretty light. I showed her a picture of what she did last time. Once she put the bleach on I could tell she was trying to rush me out. Usually my hair processes for 30-40 mins under heat, but she came to check me after 5 mins. Then again 5 mins later. She pulled me out to start rinsing after 20 mins! Needless to say my hair was not what we talked about. She tried telling me once I washed it a few times it will lighten up, I am 100% sure not matter how many times I wash my hair it will not be what 20 more mins of processing under heat would have resulted in. So after months of saving for my hair appointment and the child care too, I am left with hair I hate and it will be months before I can justify spending that much on that kind of luxury again. If she would have just canceled I would be frustrated, but would have gone to someone else and most likely gotten what I wanted. But instead she rushed me out and I am frustrated and angry to have spent so much money and not ended up with something even close to what I wanted.","{""Friends"":121,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/2GqjCu3zgQTAluzQ_RP8vg/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Ehrenberg, AZ"",""Photos"":3,""Reviews_made"":7,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=AX89ipqJaRmuI3ryO4bNkA"",""Username"":""Katie S.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/EmtLxn6sene5KMHPrrAvwQ/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":2,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""Hi Katie, my name is Christy.

She got the vegan/gluten free biscuits and gravy. They didn't have the depth of flavor as traditional biscuits and gravy but they were pretty good still. The gravy was a mushroom sauce instead of cream and sausage. I got the eggs Benedict. I didn't love the Hollandaise sauce as it was a little thin and lacked flavor. But the eggs Benedict was served on a delicious biscuit instead of a standard English muffin. The biscuits were flaky and had herbs and cheese incorporated for a nice flavor. Since we were getting brunch at a wine place it seemed like a no brainer to have mimosas as well. 

To be a wine club member you have to buy three bottles per quarter. When you come to pick up your wine it comes with a free food item from the kitchen. Today's was a pumpkin pie appetizer which was a nice treat. Members get two free wine tastings per visit as well as 10% off all purchases.

The servers were all super friendly and nice, and while the service was a little on the slower side, we did not mind too much as we were there to relax in good company. 

The best entree that we ordered was the shrimp enchiladas and the second best was the beef chimichanga plate!  We also ordered the combination plate but felt that the other two were the stars of the show.

A few things to be aware of, there is limited parking in the area due to ongoing construction work being done.  Also, due to the nearby construction, there is debris and the lingering smell of heavy tar in the air while you are sitting in the outdoor patio area. 
In my opinion, the portions are on the smaller side and if you are super hungry you may want to consider ordering an appetizer + entree, or even an extra entree to split. 

Unfortunately, I have to detract a star because the iced Diet Coke that we ordered was flat and also had the aftertaste of soap.

Today, September 8, was their grand opening. We went today for lunch. I'll come back and if they improve I'll update my review. Do not trust reviews before September 8; they are all five stars and look manufactured or by owner's friends. \n\nI am a Yelp Elite. My reviews are real. Look at all the photos I took today. \n\n1. Pure chaos as we walked in. No one welcomed us. No one even tried to seat us. They eventually tried to take my name on a makeshift piece of paper. That's it. We had to resort to our own device and pointed out there is an empty table right there. They said they would bus the table and seat us there once clean. Nope. 10 minutes passed. No action. We sat down at the dirty table. Finally they bussed the table. \n\n2. No one came to wait on us. They ignored their guests. ON THE GRAND OPENING DAY. The table next to us suffered the same fate. The gentleman finally said loudly excuse me as waiters walked up and down right past all of our tables. Nobody stopped to respond to him either. \n\n3. We walked up to the counter to place our order, thinking maybe that's how things should be. They asked us to sit down and they'd come to our table with menus. More wait. Nothing happened. \n\n4. When finally they came to take our order, they made mistakes. First part of our order came relatively quickly: two minced pork rice and Taiwanese basil chicken. All good so far. \n\nThe highlight was the dual sausage \""burger\"" 大腸包小腸。 Unique and nearly as good as what you would find in a Taiwanese street market. \n\nI would say relatively authentic tasting when compared to Jumble Jumble Cafe and Taipei Cafe in Rockville MD and other similar Taiwanese eateries in the greater DC area. Small and simple menu. But good. \n\nBasil French fries were good, though not as special as I imagined. \n\n5. My beef noodle never came. They brought out a minced pork rice dish. I didn't order that. More wait. They brought TWO more minced pork rice bowls to our table (my friends had already finished theirs!). \nThey only had about 6 tables. how can they be so inefficient and confused? \n\n7. I had to walk up to the counter and get the attention of one of the staff members. Finally she went into the kitchen and told them it should be a beef noodle. More wait. Finally (when our table had finished everything) my main dish came. This is unacceptable given their pricing and the nice decoration (which suggests otherwise this is not a \""hole-in-the-wall\"" cheap place).\n\n8. Beef noodle is good. Level of spice perfect. But the carrots were huge. Not sure why they had to cut them so huge. Impossible to pick up with chopsticks. Too big to bite into. And they weren't even cooked through. Not soft at all. \n\nI would not come all this way for their beef noodle. Compare this to the same dish at TNR Cafe (Court House, Arlington VA), Mala Tang (Clarendon, Arlington VA) and other places in Rockville. It doesn't stand out (it's not bad but not unique or a \""must have\""). Or compare it to 半畝園 A&J (both locations in Annandale VA and in Rockville MD)\n\n9. They really have to work out the kinks in their service. I would say in terms of food (dishes other than beef noodle) they deserve 4 stars; service just 2 stars\n\n10. Toilet is clean but I hate that urinal sticking in my nose when I sat on the toilet. See the picture. Painting in the toilet (Canine Daily) humorous which is good."",""Date"":""09/09/2018"",""Images"":[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tYqKFal_2emiFayJogePyw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HGF6m75i4_VmwM2bLjyiHg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QPfNbQFPaiDiM46Y2Kug7w/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/77EsIV1Hh7bWlmenrkh0JA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3nYyotYSB_QJfrgNfegjTw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hYLxday__CLYZ_pQQJ7rLw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KJgXXnLGRBjUxU-6Rj6fNA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wVsY4JhltTyKqSQ2Xjv0Qg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kPUge4paDQC775bdOc-l4Q/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DBjXGbBwiIglK--7OjoWgw/348s.jpg""],""User_Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/Gtu3tC-Jfwj7LntPR_WW6Q/60s.jpg"",""Username"":""Alice J.""}]",3,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","Momo's Cafe",""

I am a matcha girl all the way, but the owner Lawrence convinced me otherwise and now I am hooked! Fun to drink, this concoction is slightly sweet, slightly smooth, slightly creamy, and slightly salty. All the flavors and textures together make for a party in your mouth!

Momo's Cafe is just a few minutes from Clemyjontri Park so it has been one of my favorite post-playdate spots to refuel. I'm all for the Taiwanese popcorn chicken (a little bit spicy) and the braised pork and rice (literally tastes like home!).

For students living nearby they offer lunchbox specials which seems pretty clutch for someone sick of eating cafeteria food all the time (#ricelife) and they also do large scale Taiwanese catering.The menu changes often as they experiment with other home-style dishes.

"momos-cafe-washington","""26/10/2018""",4,"After a year of hunting for legit Asian food in DC, I have finally found the food of my people. It's nestled deep within Georgetown and entirely inaccessible by the metro, but I'm already thinking about when I can go again and treat myself. 

My friends and I ordered a popcorn chicken appetizer to share, which came in huge crispy chunks. It was delicious but pretty expensive: $7.50 for maybe 8-10 pieces :( I had beef noodle soup and I was blown away by how flavorful and tender the beef slices were. They just fell apart in my mouth and I ended up eating my friend's when she couldn't finish LOL. The broth was flavorful but there really wasn't a lot of it, compared to the huge mound of noodles. I also liked that they gave a small side of pickled mustard greens for you to add in yourself. Another friend had the minced pork over rice, which was also good but a little sweeter than what I'm used to. 

No Taiwanese meal is complete without boba, and I'm absolutely a huge snob about it. Momo's house milk tea made me feel like I was home. The boba was sweet and perfectly chewy, and the flavor of tea wasn't overpowered by the milk either. It was a litttttle on the sweet side but I usually get my drinks 25-50% sugar, so it's probably normal for most people. 

I really want to give it 5 stars for quality of food, but the price is just a tad bit too high considering portion sizes. However, I'll definitely be coming back soon for comfort food.

"momos-cafe-washington","""25/08/2018""",4,"Unique tea and dessert offerings in an Instagram-worthy cafe setting! I'll definitely be back for the unique milk foam teas and to see how the menu develops.

I have been craving boba milk teas all summer so I was already thrilled to have an option right in the neighborhood. On our server's recommendation I ordered the milk foam green tea - it is not just milk foam! It is more like the trendy salted cheese tea that I stood in line to get at Happy Lemon in California: https://www.thekitchn.com/what-is-cheese-tea-food-trend-253576. I haven't yet found this in DC so that alone is worth a visit for food trend followers. A thick creamy milk foam, subtly savory, tops lightly sweetened chilled tea for a surprisingly delicious combo. 

The menu is quite good but still evolving - notably, there are no vegetarian options but we were told that the chef is working on some items. We were still happy with our food selections: a simple and satisfying chicken katsu sandwich (my husband described it as a tasty Taiwanese club sandwich) and rich, buttery sizzling noodles. The fried ice cream is noteworthy. Fried ice cream is something that I order infrequently, usually for novelty, but the one offered by Momo's is especially good - it tastes like a fresh donut filled with ice cream!

The service was very welcoming. We had a fussy infant in tow and the staff helped us move the table to fit his baby carrier in the booth (there are also high chairs available). The ambiance is trendy; an attractive light-filled interior with fun touches like a wall of flowers that make a great back drop for selfies and foodie photos. Night owls will be happy to know that Momo's Cafe is open until 11:00 pm, as most restaurants in the Palisades close by 9:00 pm.","{""Friends"":62,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/XjiaDS8R6R7llowWlpzpFQ/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Washington, DC"",""Photos"":377,""Reviews_made"":264,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=CjC05Kp4BA4HDJkfWQeUMg"",""Username"":""Vivian R.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/EzJ4i11wM2L5YBTJSEbCCg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/c_cHeSRKJxjrvPY2NTL1KQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CCuzMKiI55VEjTI7gJYFxQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Qy7qaSrj9ZxsvQ_R8WFOww/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vE4Hp8NlOOCxpBX3wPLCKg/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":2,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",1,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","Momo's Cafe",""
"momos-cafe-washington","""24/09/2018""",4,"Super excited to try this new Taiwanese restaurant for a whole bunch of reasons. One, it's new and it's local, so need to support small and local businesses, check! Second, it offers bubble tea, check! Third, it's a Taiwanese restaurant so it concurrently increases the number of area establishments featuring Taiwanese cuisine AND increases the diversity of options for eating out, last, but not least, it's in an adorable, quaint and eclectic strip of shops offering everything from dog grooming to vintage consignment to various cuisines. What's not to love? Best of all, fellow Yelpers have already come and sampled the new fare, thus decreasing the risk of having to execute several awkward U-turns on MacArthur Boulevard being all for naught.

So I stopped by on my way home early from work. I'd missed lunch and there was no way I'd last until dinner. The opportunity seemed too good to pass up. Because Momo's Cafe is on the southbound side of MacArthur, be aware this means you'll have to make a U-turn a few intersections north of the restaurant. Also, street parking is fairly scarce so you'll have to rely on luck or be a bit innovative depending on time of day. If you're on a date, perhaps Uber or pick a nice evening where a little stroll is welcome.

I ordered Momo's milk tea with boba, fried dumplings (6 pieces), and an order of braised minced pork on rice. (Yes, way too much food but as I said I was hungry plus I just had to try out their bubble tea).

The bubble tea was very good. Boba were nice and chewy. It was a bit sweeter than I like ... not sure I'd make a special run here for bubble tea but I would not say no if given the chance to have another. They do have limited flavors though (but also offer milk foam, sooo ...)

The dumplings were tasty: nicely crunchy but not overdone. Skin was nice and thin, and it came with a good sweet sauce for dipping.

The braised pork was quite fatty - which is actually desirable in an authentic Taiwanese dish but perhaps too much so for my clearly Anglicized tastes (plus I was full of bubble tea and dumplings by then). The portion of meat was a bit small but the entire bento was a nice-sized portion, heaped full with rice, steamed broccoli, an egg and some Chinese veggies. 

Definitely worth trying out, and I wish them much success!","{""Friends"":144,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/o6WNHLWwsZIBB1l3W04wJg/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Bethesda, MD"",""Photos"":1928,""Reviews_made"":592,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=kGKzgap3820RDVLJBihYxA"",""Username"":""Ann C.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VM_LrShQj_SCXHmueMP7jg/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":2,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""I'm really glad you wound up checking us out, Ann.

The items were packaged nicely with utensils included, and they had their logo on them which I thought was a nice touch. Nice portion of the popcorn chicken, decent flavor. I do think they should consider making a special sauce on the side for folks to dip their chicken in.

I ordered the Italian Beef and it came out nice and soggy with lots of shaved beef. The bread is an extremely important component, and it held up well to the juice. The sandwich was very tasty, and wins over Portillo's. 

I also ordered the chili out of curiosity. It tasted more like brown gravy with meat and beans added. Since I like gravy, it wasn't terrible, but I'm not going to get that again. I may enter such a concoction in a chili cookoff as a joke, though...

"sani-bright-carpet-cleaning-indianapolis","""10/02/2022""",1,"Update: I recently found out Sani bright made claims my rugs had pre existing conditions that didn't exist. Making unfounded claims there was fringe damage and fiber damage is unethical. What's worse, this was not discussed at drop off with me and I did not see any pre existing conditions marked on the receipt. A reputable company would discuss any issues with the rug at drop off and put detailed notations on the receipt. I dont know if they added the pre existing conditions after I signed my receipt or not. In my case, there were no issues with my rugs but Sani bright said there were and said he discussed them with me. This was not only untrue....you can see there is no fringe and fiber damage! 

Merchant claimed they take before and after photos of every rug they clean but they delivered mine where they missed a step. Obviously,they do not take the pictures they say they do. These chemicals sat on my rug for nearly 2 weeks which must explain why they could not get the stains out. After delivering my rug after recleaning it, they attempted to just drop it off without examining it but I requested an inspection. When stains were present, they didn't have an explanation except the owner would need to come out. He never did. They said they had nothing to document the findings on so I had to make a copy of their delivery receipt so they could document. The merchant later claimed there were no stains in spite of documentation! The other 2 rugs were exposed to excessive wear and tear. Film left on one rug and another doesn't look like they dried it flat because the sides curl under. Clearly, they are not equipped to clean fine oriental and antique rugs. 

Sani bright made no effort to refund the cost of the rug they stained. I was only able to recover the cost of the cleaning but I had to dispute the charge with my credit card. What's worse , Sani bright attempted to state they did nothing wrong! Fortunately, I had pictures of the stains, along with the true condition of the fringe and fiber. 

I found out the hard way that positive reviews may not always be enough.

"hula-boba-kapolei-kapolei","""08/07/2016""",4,"I don't love bubble tea but my sister loves this place. Plus the thought of choosing as many different toppings (or bottomings?) as I wanted seemed pretty cool. And they have much, MUCH more than just milk tea so I was pretty excited to try it.

I came here 3 times during my visit to Hawaii. I've tried the mango green tea, earl grey tea, and macadamia milk tea. They were all good but for the milk tea, I couldn't taste the macadamia. I couldn't tell what flavor it was trying to be. The best part is you get to choose your sweetness level. That's probably the worst part of the standard NYC bubble tea places. It's either no sugar, less sugar, or diabetes. But here, you choose your percentage level.

It's $5.50 for a large (which is probably the size of a quart of those Chinese take out containers). If you fill it up with toppings to the first line, it's included in the price. If you're over the first line, it's an extra 75 cents. If you pass two lines, then it's an extra $2. Right under the first line was fine for me because it's really filling. The toppings seem fresh. They probably get a lot of business so they're continuously making the toppings. However, whenever I saw the mini tapioca, it always looked mushy like it was overcooked. Before Hula Boba, I never really liked jelly, but they've converted me. So many different flavors too, depending on the day - coffee, coconut, grape, mango, lychee, strawberry were all ones that I saw there.

It consisted of: 2020 Vermentino, 2020 Rosé of Valdiguié, and 2020 Rosé of Syrah. All were good and not too strong. From the regular menu we also ordered bread and olives, the vegan/gluten free bread was amazing, I couldn't tell the difference. From the menu I ordered the cheese board w/ brie instead of the vegan mozzarella. It was great to get and individual cheese board, it was delicious. Then for the entree I got the cioppino which was gluten free, it was amazing. It wasn't too spicy or overcooked, it was perfect and not overpowered by the fennel. Then for dessert I had the vegan pear shortbread tart. Its ice cream you couldn't tell it was vegan. It was so good and you couldn't tell if the tart was vegan either. I was pleasantly surprised how good the vegan baked goods and dessert were. Typically, gluten free or vegan baked treats are more dense and gummy.

"sapphire-beauty-lounge-newark","""19/08/2018""",3,"I booked an appointment online for an acrylic fill with Sapphire. The salon is very pretty - the white decor gives off a very modern aesthetic. The nail tech commented that my existing acrylics were thick - a bit ironic because I felt that my finished nails from Sapphire were a bit thick. She proceeded to clip off the lifting acrylic from my 3 week old set and began filling the nails without any prep to the cuticles. My cuticles weren't super bad or anything but I think cleaning them up would help the finished product look so much cleaner. The nail tech took her time shaping my nails to a nice coffin shape. The acrylic is quite thin and flat (I did not notice until I got home) on my right thumb near the cuticle area so I am expecting significant lifting in a couple of weeks. I selected a matte topcoat for all nails except for the accent nails but you can see that the nail tech did not apply the matte all the way to the edges of the nail - you can still see some glossy polish around the edges. Overall, I went to Sapphire expecting to pay less than my fill at Pamper Nail salon in Fremont however, the total for an acrylic fill with a pink gel polish + matte topcoat + 2 accent nails with nail foil was over $45 without a tip. The nail foil accent was cute and they seem to have many options for gel nail color (a pretty vast selection of nude colors which are my favorite) and nail foils to complement the polish you select.","{""Friends"":180,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/1FM4D78F76aqVeuGW3DsfQ/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Newark, CA"",""Photos"":62,""Reviews_made"":41,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=wKENLsKZyhCKsitpuqnZow"",""Username"":""Kim S.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OGolhmXBcpkn4AZl6TYFkg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/aJHtOvDFpkIXH44k59DWZQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2GN8CbmYrDqzNfWFkSibmg/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""Hi Kim!

They have all the trappings of an Instagrammable restaurant--a pretty floral wall outside, a small and sleek interior, colorful boba drinks, and exciting and exotic dishes you can find in Taiwan. 

The braised pork rice was comforting and tasty, but it wasn't as memorable as others I've tried in the area. I will say that I appreciated that it wasn't too salty. I would order this again, but I wouldn't make the drive into the city just for it. Milk tea was above average, but again not something I'd travel for. Some of the other dishes we tried felt like they'd been sitting under the heat lamp too long. Not a fan. For this type of fare, I'd prefer A&J or my beloved Taiwan Cafe, both in the 'burbs. These places have no bells and whistles, but their food is consistently satisfying and worth the drive every time. 

Our pink-haired server was very nice and helpful, but her dark-haired colleague was the opposite of amicable and made it clear that she was only willing to do the bare minimum required of her job. Unless she's related to management (or even if she is), I'd suggest letting her go so that someone more deserving can fill this position and draw and maintain customers. 

They're tucked into the same strip mall as the sublime Kotobuki, and street parking is relatively easy to find.

We spent about $50 on delivery for a beef noodle soup, popcorn chicken, and minced pork rice.

They tried to spread out the noodles in the take out box to look fuller, but the tiny half container (of a tiny container) of soup made me really annoyed.  Also, looking at the takeout for the minced pork, it's a shallow container compared to typical takeout boxes. This was my cheat day of eating take out and it was ruined by tiny portions.

This cafe serves authentic and innovative Taiwanese dishes and drinks at a very reasonable price. I parked at the closed down Safeway across the street and made my way over to try  the lemon black tea, green tea with milk foam, momo's bubble milk tea, popcorn chicken, braised pork over rice, a taro sausage and more!

The drinks are on a different level than your average bubble tea. They feel handcrafted and unique and complex. My favorite was the green tea with milk foam. The flavor was wonderful but on top of that, there were a couple of different textures you could drink whether you drank just the foam, the foam with the tea or just the tea. The owner explained it all to us and it was lovely to get a background of the restaurant and also a quick intro on their thought process when creating the drinks.

The food was delicious, overall my favorite was the braised pork over rice followed by the popcorn chicken. I would love to come back and dine in and try some of the other dishes they have on their menu.

So it is with bittersweet emotion that i write this update.

One day R and I were mourning the passing of the other Cambodian restaurant while we were deciding what to have for lunch. I mentioned, oh isn't there that other restaurant still?
So off we went the Phnom Penh.
I still don't know how to pronounce the P's in Thai. I guess I'll ask them next I go.

I got the vegetable tofu curry noodle soup, and R got the original khmer stirred pan noodles with pork.
Omg delicious! So much flavor, so much tofu. Fresh vegetables. The spicy is SPICY!

We will certainly be back here quite a bit now.

I will say though, they really need to update their interior and their lighting situation. It's really hard overhead lighting and not a cozy dinner date spot. You're on W 25!

"pep-boys-la-mirada-5","""02/09/2017""",5,"My husband and I usually go to the Pepboys in cerritos but this location is closer to our house. Yesterday after work, I noticed an extra beep when I turned over my engine. I had a feeling it may be due to my battery so I asked my husband to test it when I got home. Unfortunately, we did not have a device to check the battery so he said he would stop by this location the next day to make sure everything was alright.

I have been purchasing my batteries via pepboys for more than a few years now. However, my battery some how never lasts to it's warranty end date. It always craps out before. (I buy a bosch one too. I thought they were good.) Luckily, the last time I was able to get it replaced before the warranty ended. No questions asked and easy replacement. 

This time was a bit different, my husband brought it and they were able to locate the last replacement date. However, they were asking him if he had the original purchase receipt of my original one to see if it was still under warranty. I informed my husband over the phone it has been a few years and there is no way I would be able to locate my receipt. He said the store manager said if unable to locate, they would not be able to see if I qualified for a replacement. Due to my battery being confirmed to be a dead one, I had no choice but to purchase a new one and hope it would last for the lifetime promised. 

After my husband got off the phone with me, the manager Rafael made an exception and allowed for a replacement of the battery under warranty. It was so very nice of him since this replacement battery also died before the lifetime it promised. There was quite a line in the car shop so he said my husband and baby would have to wait a while prior to being serviced. Not sure if it was because he felt bad that my husband had an infant in the dreadful heat or what, he decided to pull one of the mechanics, Jose to help change out the battery real quick and install the new one in. This was above and beyond what the manager needed to do but I am so grateful he was thoughtful enough to help my husband so efficiently to prevent my baby from suffering in the heat while waiting.

Even though I was not present during this whole ordeal, I was involved in the process to a point and I can only say I am very thankful for Rafael and Jose's customer service. Thank you for being so considerate and understanding. Also, thank you for honoring your battery warranties. I will definitely be coming to this location instead for future needs.

I'm not sure why this location always seems chaotic. I'm disappointed that I ordered online for pickup and said it'd be ready at a certain time and I came even 10 min after the promised time but it wasn't ready or even seemed to be in the system possibly because the front has to tell the back about the order. 

I also paid extra for the sauce for my oysters but it didn't come with it. The seafood stew I ordered came in a cardboard box take out instead of a soup take out and spilled. I had to ask for ice for my oysters . And sadly they only have us a half piece of bread for the stew

I prefer the Napa location

"hog-island-larkspur-larkspur","""14/10/2024""",3,"The first paragraph is solely about my experience dining as a parent. Skip if that doesn't apply to you. TL;DR at the end.

At this price point I do expect good service and that means seating us at an appropriately sized table (my 3 year old is also a whole human), serving water and utensils to my child, and being able to explain the menu ingredients so that I can order food her developing palate can enjoy. 

Clam Fettuccini - Red chili flakes is the last ingredient, but that is all you will taste. No signature clam flavor in the broth. Also, the waiter didn't mention this was spicy; I was expecting just a garnish of red chili flakes. 

Tomato Salad - It was tomatoes, chili crisp, goat cheese, fennel, basil, and black sesame seeds. The tomatoes got lost. 

Grilled Oysters Lime Mezcal - Gritty and lacked flavor. They don't tell you the origin of the oysters, unlike with the chilled options. 

Seafood Stew - Nice hearty portion with lots of protein (my kid mostly ate this). I would've paid more and enjoyed it more if it had some sweet, meaty crab to balance out the textures and flavors. 

Acme Bread and Butter ($4) - I was expecting slices of the iconic crusty-outside, soft-inside loaves for which Acme is known. Instead, we received jagged little baguettes that were all crust (good for dipping in soup, but not on their own).

TL;DR: Service doesn't match price. Flavor combinations overpower the ingredients. Only well-executed dish was the seafood stew, although I wish the broth had more seafood oomph to it. Maybe if I had gotten raw oysters like everyone else I would've enjoyed the meal more. NOT kid-friendly.","{""Friends"":208,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/ftYYysgy4S0fpRQPl7dPIg/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Oakland, CA"",""Photos"":528,""Reviews_made"":348,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=M9f1_TmxxKyaGfLN3kAvbA"",""Username"":""Marie S.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SDiVGUsdx70NBMtCdreWQw/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",4,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","Hog Island Larkspur",true

Who doesn't love Hog Island and its oyster farm in Marshall, CA?  If anyone thinks it has anything to do with pork; hence the name, then you don't like oysters/seafood, or can't claim you're a foodie, or know anything about the Bay Areaaaaaaa.  I would have to unfriend you j/k not really.  I suggest you read how it got its name though.

This is one of their oyster bar joints in Marin Country Mart, so happy they've moved into this location with breathtaking views of the Bay and Golden Gate Ferry.  They took over the former Togo's Sandwiches shop.  If you've been to their other locations besides the actual farm, you'll agree this location in the 415 has the best views, more so than SF's, and ample parking in Larkspur.

"hog-island-larkspur-larkspur","""09/03/2022""",5,"It was a bright sun shining day and happy hour was calling my name. Since hearing that happy hour is back, Hog Island Larkspur was on my list. Happy hour is on Monday - Thursday from 4-6 pm.

The happy hour menu is quite limited and was on the pricey side, but ""treat yo self"" is always in season. 

Oysters:
Always fresh, meaty, and big! Seriously, $2 for the happy hour oysters is worth sitting in traffic for a happy tummy. 

Canned tuna:
I know, $9 for canned seafood is wild. But that's just it. This is wild caught and canned in really good olive oil. You'll want to pay $20 after eating this. Happy hour menu rotates which canned seafood is available for a reduced price. You can try the others on the menu anytime.

Farmers market mule:
A herby tequila based drink at $10 was not only beautiful, but delicious too. On sunny day, it sips just right. 

There's a lot to choose from on the larger menu. Pick your spot, indoors or outdoors and enjoy. I've never had a bad meal. The bread and butter always hits the spot. They also sell fresh raw seafood if you want to be the chef at home. 


P.S. if you want to skip the traffic during the afternoon commute, park near Trader Joe's and walk to your happy destination. Read the signs!

"blue-elephant-thai-restaurant-coralville","""15/05/2023""",2,"This review is based on the take away service only (unfortunately). We could smell the food but never got to taste it. I placed an order early evening to beat the rush. The wait for the food was 45-60 minutes when we ordered. No big deal. Using a bit of caution, I arrived at the restaurant after 55 minutes. After waiting for 10, I inquired about our order and was told it would be - at best - another 30 min, maybe longer. Frustrating to say the least after placing an order 65 minutes earlier and driving 17 minutes to the restaurant. I recognize places get busy, especially on the weekend, but when you miss the approximate order easy time by over 50% and expect people to wait an additional 30+ minutes for takeout after they arrive at the time the restaurant suggested, places have to do better. This was our first attempt with Blue Elephant and the staff was nice enough so we'll give it another shot.

"blue-elephant-thai-restaurant-coralville","""14/07/2020""",5,"Sought this restaurant out while looking for a Thai restaurant in Iowa, apparently a relatively rare thing. 

They have a pretty extensive menu, featuring 10 different non-alcoholic beverages, 14 different appetizers, 6 kinds of soup, and 40 different entrees, not counting meat variations. It was hard to settle on one or two things, so we ordered a few things for just the two of us. They were very accommodating of spice level, as I like more and my wife likes little. 

I must note that every dish we ordered was beautifully presented (see photos).  To me, flavor is more important, but I wanted to mention that for people who care about that kind of thing.  It certainly makes the food look more appetizing. 

Here is our order and our comments for each:

6 crab ragoons - excellently fried, generous amount of cream cheese, couldn't taste much crab, but that isn't unusual for these. 

Som Tum (Spicy green papaya salad) - sweet and spicy. Being that it was green papaya, you don't get any real papaya flavor, but it added a nice bit of freshness to the meal. 

Tom Kar (Kha) soup - a lighter variation, but it had a nice blend of vegetables (see menu), ample meat (we had pork), and again, so beautifully presented. 

Entrees:
Spicy eggplant - plenty of eggplant and meat (some restaurants skimp on these), very good flavor. 

Duck with Red Curry -  My favorite Thai dish is Roast Duck Curry, and though I could not find any crispy duck skin that I expected and it seemed to have been cooked in the sauce instead of roasted, to be fair, it wasn't touted as such.  Nevertheless this was at least tie for the best of this dish I have ever had.  The reason I like the dish is that it has such a deep and varied flavor profile based on all of the ingredients and spices included. (See menu).  The Blue Elephant's rendition was very nuanced and fragrant. I was extremely happy with it. 

I must finish by saying we very much appreciated our sweet server Gina, and enjoyed chatting with the owner and chef. I hope the people of this area will patronize this worthy establishment.","{""Friends"":1,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/gO1YKOpCwHg1ceM7cWB1-w/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Turtle Creek, PA"",""Photos"":33,""Reviews_made"":17,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=epMs3-RkS8LWFNOdZFkelQ"",""Username"":""Stephen L.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/boltT8OBZx_tUpSqDATlhg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9ZgkRRguq_em7dr8tMaC-A/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zcEec8kZK2R5ckjC0FiaTA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/LvehGi647oeulVe407xHhw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qLaz9lG7eojWMcnXUTVwLg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/iSVkc-krFergZqa1jMPNxg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/eyy73wvg3897vaM08jxz9A/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",8,"","0 check-in","Blue Elephant Thai Restaurant",true

The ability to choose a spiciness level offers some customization for those with varying palates.  The portions in my orders were significant, don't worry about needing extra.
They have adapted to the times by adding online ordering to make it easier. Ordering and pick-up has been very smooth both times,once by phone and once online. My only qualm is that their online system had a $15 min, so with most entrees in the $12-13 range, I ended up having to order something extra to use it.","{""Friends"":48,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/kX5qHy8JDBgso8U99Ge0Rg/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""North Liberty, IA"",""Photos"":1026,""Reviews_made"":209,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=PTEqhMWQWX0cYMQ4wJGbLQ"",""Username"":""Paul V.""}","null","[{""Number"":2,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",9,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","Blue Elephant Thai Restaurant",true

Our server took our drink order and the drinks came promptly. We also ordered a couple of appetizers to start off with. We had the cheese bread and calamari. We wanted to chat over drinks and appetizers for awhile before ordering our entrees but felt a little rushed as the server came by a handful of times to ask if we wanted to order.

"zizikis-dallas-2","""06/11/2022""",5,"This review is for the combination of my room
Rental for a private event and a casual dining experience. 

The private event was a rehearsal dinner for my wedding which I planned entirely remotely and from out of state. Everything was phenomenal and exceeded expectations. The service was great, flexibility to discuss the right menu format for the guests and the honest recommendation for deciding on a beer/wine package or bar. I worked with Miguel and he was wonderful. During the rehearsal we settled on a number of wine bottles and once we ran out Miguel was great with his
Flexibility when I just asked for the staff to keep an eye on empty glasses and keep refilling as necessary. 

Only feedback I had was if doing pre fix menu to have menus for the guests to only highlight those options rather than seeing the whole menu then telling guests what they are limited too. If not possible,  if the restaurant to let the host know in case they want to print their own menu. 

Casual dining experience: returned for dinner with my husband after we moved to town and food was wonderful and delicious. We're from Chicago so having a lit Saganaki experience is nostalgic for us. The cheese was a great temperature and had a slight touch of sweetness that was not overpowering. I had the Moussaka and so delicious. I love that it's ground lamb that's used along with the layering. I'm carb conscious and I'll have my moments of splurging. What I like about the layering is the eggplant and potatoes are separate. The potatoes are at the bottom so I could control how much potato I chose to consume with each bite. Sauce was great!  Hubby had lamb burger and meat was seasoned nicely. Have to eat it some what quickly because it's juicy and will make the pita bread it comes with soggy. Also had the cream based lemon soup which had depth and didn't fall flat. I had it with the meatball. Tasty but meatball is a little salty. I wanted
To dump capers, noodles and crab meat in that broth it was so good!

We came here on Saturday night to celebrate one of our parent's birthdays. The table we got outside was dirty and literally NOTHING was set up anywhere. Three different people had to come and get everything arranged and the woman who was our server did not know which wines were in stock and seriously had to go back-and-forth several times until she managed to find an available bottle. So, so stupid. The mule had ZERO alcohol in it.

Apps: calamari was rubber; trio of dips were uninspired and the pita came out of an Aramark bag. The Greek platter had dishes that were previously made and barely warmed up. Everything tasted like it was thawed. The lamb souvlaki was passable, but just barely (also had nasty pita). 

Seriously dessert was the only thing we all semi-enjoyed. The baklava ice cream cake was enjoyable except for it drowning in honey and our daughter enjoyed the chocolate mousse cake.

All in all, though, terrible service and terrible food. This restaurant has its best years behind it. Everything was run down, untidy, and felt chaotic.

"hog-island-larkspur-larkspur","""10/12/2023""",3,"Hog Island Larkspur is probably the most accessible for those of us in the East Bay craving some oysters and Marin county goodness.

There's ample free parking, outdoor and indoor seating, kid and dog-friendly. Public restrooms in the outdoor shopping plaza, and it's a great spot to sit in the sun and enjoy the ocean air. The menu is expected to be $$$ and the portions small, that was the biggest bummer. I don't get how someone just ordered their bread and butter and called it a meal, like ya girl was still hungry after this stop. We got 6 oysters to share between two of us, and we got one of each variety they had. I wish there were labels so we knew what we were eating AND there were a variety of dressings in addition to lemon, but the oysters were tasty. Nothing mind-blowing though. We had their calamari appetizer which was a grilled squid with a lemon-parsley sauce that was reminiscent of chimichurri sauce. It was flavorful but oily and on the small size. The shrimp po-boy was on yummy Acme bread from Berkeley, and fries were the big winner. Daikon slaw was refreshing. Our server was alright, the ambiance outside was nice in the sun. 

The dishes didn't have much impact on us, but it did satisfy our oyster cravings. Great spot to hit after a morning hike. I would rather drive out farther north to get Bodega Bay oysters, or to the oceanside for the OG Hog Island in Marshall. My favorite oyster experience will still be A.W. Shuck's in Carmel, SO many fab spots down there with less ""bouge"" and greater service.","{""Friends"":563,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/ieGWwLRzSS3w8TYkrZkXvA/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Silicon Valley, CA"",""Photos"":2691,""Reviews_made"":1335,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=0VYzR15p6G18-2_KCsvuEw"",""Username"":""Jodi H.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/suJ-7P0O1yh567KK7F5iJw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/LvHGs9lmRbnx77i1wO5p7g/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":4,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":2,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",3,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","Hog Island Larkspur",true

I did steal a bite of my cousins Salmon and it is amazing. This prompted me to order two meals to go for my husband and I when I got home, and a bottle of the wine we had. 
Gretchen made me feel very welcomed and then surprised us with a birthday cake for my cousin's husband and when she brought out our to go orders she cautioned to carry the bags from the bottom and not the thin handles so that the bag doesn't break from the weight of the wine bottles.

The small order was extremely small, so we decided to then order the Artichoke Dip and Pita bread to give ourselves a little more filling before ordering entrees.  The Spanakopita had a great taste, but the very top layer of the phyllo dough was too tough to slice.  It was either too dry or baked too long.  The artichoke dip tasted like sour water to me.  There was no good flavor to the dip, and I had no taste of artichoke whatsoever.  The only thing good about it was the warm pita bread.

For my entrée, I ordered the Salmon Filet, which came with couscous and asparagus.  My meal was wonderfully cooked, from the medium salmon filet that had a nice Mediterranean taste, to the amazing tomato sauce that mixed well with both the asparagus and couscous.  I highly recommend this dish if you're looking for something on the lighter side.

I also had a taste of the Lamb Salad and I can definitely say that I've had much better tasting lamb at other Greek restaurants.

Overall, I liked the food here, but I wasn't too impressed with the appetizer choices.  I'll definitely come back again one day to try brunch; on a Saturday that is.","{""Friends"":594,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/qwQ2LVJsOAoZXaXS5HMNrg/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Dallas, TX"",""Photos"":1406,""Reviews_made"":880,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Jk-2JlKDKaZK2e5HV6Wx8g"",""Username"":""Lily M.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/j98I_rx-_pCM6dJvOEoV5A/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/C73dBKrTVDqx6ssK0DdoRA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HmG_vPT1-YU5P4ECFNQvzg/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":3,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",108,"","0 check-in","Ziziki's",true

"zizikis-dallas-2","""25/05/2010""",5,"Feta + calamato olives + lamb = GREEK!

I've been here a couple of  times with a friend on weekends and once with my brother on a weekday without a reservation.  We were seated swiftly each time.  I've tried 2 different entrees which were both yumtastic (Yes, i said yumtastic).  My friend and I started with the soft, warm mediterranean bread as an appetizer (both visits) which was topped with the FRESHEST ingredients (feta, spinach, tomato, cucumber) served w/a side of that wonderful cucumber ziziki sauce.  My brother & I started with the trio appetizer - better than the mediterranean bread!  The artichoke hummus was so-so, though.

My friend had the stuffed lamb entree with asparagus both times and loved it...I tasted it, it's very good.  My bro had the same.  I've had 2 lamb dishes, the sweet Mousaka (THE BEST!) twice, which has tons of eggplant, and the Pastichio which does not have eggplant :( .  Whenever I return, it's Mousaka all the way, baby! ;)  

The wine is also affordable & tasty.  I tried a glass of greek red the first time and a glass of greek white the second & third time.  I don't remember the names of the wines, though.

The building it's located in is nice to walk through at night since it has lit bushes and nice fountains.  The restaurant's atmosphere is warm and cozy with dimmed lights.  It is not a large restaurant, but I'm sure medium sized groups would not have an issue getting a group table.  They had no issue splitting a check for my friend and I, either.  They also have private dining - for parties I suppose.

-Hummus. I'm still trying to find a way to marry food. Because I totally would. It doesn't even taste like hummus because it's this beautiful buttery, garlicky, citrus spread. 
-Lamb roll. AMAZING. Comes shredded with tomatoes, rolled in a thin pita type bread. 
-Falafel. Among my once strong hatred of this cuisine, it was incredible. Slightly spicy, and crispy on the outside. 
-Saffron rice. Buttery and spiced. 
-Tzaziki sauce. Not too much Greek yogurt flavoring, which I loved. 
-Sweet potato. O.M.G. It came served whipped and mashed and beautifully sweet. 
-Chicken. Charred and Smokey tm.

"cafe-izmir-dallas","""05/08/2013""",5,"Great restaurant to visit if you're looking for somewhere new and intimate. It's located down the street from the Granada Theatre on Greenville so if you've been there then valet at the restaurant is definitely worth it during peak dinner hours. 

It's a small but very romantic setting. The decor is elegant but still allows for semi formal and casual wear, however most people are there for some type of occasion during the weekends. 

The staff is beyond accommodating and friendly, everyone really goes the extra mile to make sure you have an excellent experience. The portions are tapas so you'll be ordering several small dishes; it makes for a different and more interactive dining experience since you'll most likely be sharing a few things.

There is excellent live music on Fridays and Saturdays. The guitarist is not too loud and plays anything from American singer/songwriter hits to Latin guitar, Brazilian romance and even Persian acoustic. It adds nicely to the ambiance. 

The food is some of the best Medittarian/Persian food I've had in Dallas. If you're not sure just ask your waiter what's good, they are all of Persian or Latin descent and very helpful based on your likes and dislikes.

The grilled Monterey Calamari for $15 in a lemon parsley vinaigrette was bright and tender, and if you are looking for a light bite this side and a salad would be plenty.

The $14 Caesar salad had a nice roasted garlic-anchovy dressing.

Because I had no idea what the portion sizes were before ordering, I also got a bowl of clam chowder for $18 that was so rich and filling that I could barely finish the shellfish, much less the broth.

"zizikis-dallas-2","""11/05/2024""",1,"This one-star is solely about the greedy management. We had a reservation the other night at 7:15PM, but it was clear they had overbooked and did not limit the reservations, so we were made to stand around until nearly 8PM waiting for them to set up another table. After that, it took multiple asks and nearly another 30 minutes to get menus and waters. 1.5 hours after our reservation time (and 45 mins after ordering them), we finally had our drinks, and at that point things moved faster since the restaurant had mostly cleared out. The manager/host kept asking us if we needed anything, we'd list things like forks, plates, waters, and then he'd ask if we were doing ok 10 minutes later even though we'd gotten none of those basics we'd asked for. 

We asked a server if this was typical, and he said yes and that he was asked to drop everything and drive over from another location to help out. 

To cap it all off, when we got the bill, they told us our group of 5 was a ""large party"" and charged us an automatic 20% gratuity. Based on the rest of the experience, I wouldn't be surprised if the owners pocketed this. 

The ownership and management of this place was so bad I would give negative stars if I could. It was hard to enjoy anything about the experience being treated so poorly and I recommend you stay far, far away unless you like being treated like dirt and being served by waiters who are treated the same. This place overbooks to maximize profits and the customers and employees suffer the cost.","{""Friends"":0,""Location"":""New Albany, OH"",""Photos"":0,""Reviews_made"":3,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=YY_klazb-HZ1o2D2Pbsw2w"",""Username"":""David D.""}","null","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""David - I am the Social Media Reputation Director for Ziziki's restaurants for 8 years and adore the family who owns this restaurant. I wanted to respond to this, but it would not have been as kind as the owner's direct response below. Your review is outlandish!\n\nFROM THE OWNER:\nI do not see a reservation for David D. from Ohio in my reservation system, however I am going to respond to this review, because it is rude and offensive.  I have reviewed the cameras and payment tickets in case someone else in this party made a reservation. Since this review draws many broad and in most cases completely wrong assumptions and generalizations based on one visit of one party - I would like to offer clarifications: \n\nNO - At Ziziki’s 100% of tips, gratuities, delivery fees and service fees are going to employees.  It is very presumptuous and mean to suggest otherwise.  This entire point is completely 100% false. \n\nNO - This was not a regular weekend at Ziziki’s. SMU University graduations combined  with Mother's Day celebrations made every shift at lease 50% more busy than regular.  We were staffed accordingly and in addition to our GM, I (the owner) was there all the time.  All staff did an  amazing job throughout the weekend.\n\nYES - there were two parties on Friday that waited more than 20 minutes for a table - for which I apologize as this is not our normal operating procedure and an extremely rare (almost never) occurrence.\n\nNO - Overbooking is not our regular practice. What the reviewer fails to mention is that there were over 80 other parties that night who were seated immediately upon arrival. Again, drawing very broad conclusion in a mean review based on a single experience.  If we were overbooking - there would be many reviews complaining about this!\n\nYES - Some parties waited 45 minutes for their drinks. There was an unexpected bar printer failure - that caused it to skip tickets.  I had not noticed that failure immediately but once I did, I comped all drinks at the 2 tables that were waiting more than 45 minutes for the drinks. The printer has been replaced. Again, this is completely out of ordinary.\n\nNO - IT IS NOT Ziziki’s policy to charge automatic gratuity on parties of 5 people.  The automatic gratuity policy is printed on every menu and listed on the website.  All servers are very well aware of this policy. If this truly happened, email me at info@zizikis.com with last 4 digits of your credit card number, I will refund the incorrectly charged gratuity.  I will pay the server myself.\n\nNo - I DO NOT treat employees and customers at Zizikis like dirt - again RUDE!  This assumption is groundless and false.  Our employees work there for many years or even decades. They are supported and appreciated. Our loyal customers are very deeply valued and appreciated. \n\nThe mean spirited reviews based on a series of wrong assumptions - like this one -  are chipping away at the enthusiasm of entrepreneurs like me running small, independent restaurants."",""Date"":""14/05/2024"",""Title"":""BizUserReviewReply"",""User_Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/buphoto/6CvI7tpWl-I53YSW25TmiA/30s.jpg"",""Username"":""Kristi E.""}]",1,"","0 check-in","Ziziki's",true

If your okay with just the first part, Hog Island Larkspur is a pretty great place to visit. Nearby shops make the wait a very solid place to see.

The price of things were insane for what you get. What made it worse,m: we had a server come by 1 time. No water was refilled, or anything. I basically had to drag a waiter down to order. The server then said he would come back to tell me what oysters were which.

Maya took my order and was very patient while I took my time deciding. I got the pickled vegetables and an oyster Po'boy. 
Pickles were very good and helped cut the richness of the fries and sandwich. 
The Po'boy was on a toasted torpedo roll dressed with shredded lettuce, pickles and sauce. The roll was soft enough to make it easy to eat. There were five or six perfectly seasoned and fried oysters. They were plump, fresh and juicy. 
The star of the show were the perfectly cooked french fries. I have 60 years of fat girl experience to know a really great fry when I eat one.

I wanted to grab a quick sandwich and a beer and the waiter recommended the burger.\n\nI ordered it medium to medium-rare and it came out very well done - like completely grey and dry in the middle.  I normally feel pretty weird with sending food back but this was so dry it wasn't really edible (and the burger is like $20).\n\nI showed the waiter and he agreed and said he would have the chef remake it.  It's an open kitchen concept so when he went back to tell them I noticed the chef and line cook giving me some dirty looks.  Definitely made me feel weird but whatever.\n\nI wait a bit and get the recooked burger.  This time I cut in and it's not cooked.  I don't mean rare I mean raw - cold in the middle, the stringy ground beef.  It really felt like it wasn't an accident and just sort of the cooks way at telling me off since he didn't think the first burger was overcooked.   Side note - there are a few other reviews here describing the burger as a \""hockey puck\"" and complaining about the service staff so it sounds like it's not just me. \n\nThe server came back and asked how it was this time.  I give him a big sigh and say \""Man,  this time it's not really cooked....\"".  As I'm telling the server I notice the chef and line cook staring at me and shooting me dirty looks again.  At this point my ferry is about to leave pretty soon so I tell him not to worry about it.\n\nThis is when it got pretty weird.  I feel eyes intently staring at me and I look up and the line cook is like standing aggressively at the kitchen window cutout trying to make direct eye contact with me.  I look back at him and raise my hands up in like a shrug and look away.  He won't break the aggressive eye contact.  I eventually look back towards him and say \""Man, why are you staring at me?  You can see the burger if you want\"".   He doesn't back down.  At this point it's been a few minutes of him aggressively trying to make eye contact.  The waiter/manager comes over and I ask them what's going on.  Why is your chef staring at me... They don't really know what to say and don't talk to him or anything.\n\nThe whole situation made me really uncomfortable - it felt like I was in a weird David Lynch movie or something.  You'd think the manager would like apologize or something but nope, sorta made it feel like it was my fault.  I pay my bill after not touching either burger and they are like \""we took 15% off your bill\""  like it was a huge favor to me.\n\nHonestly, I was concerned that the guy was going to follow me outside and try to fight me because by the time I was leaving both the chef and line cook had been aggressively staring at me for like 5-10 minutes.   The whole thing was just handled pretty poorly.  I was like rushed out of the restaurant to try and deescalate but not one apology and no one talked to the chef/line cook. \n\nFor the record, I'd say like 70% of my reviews here are positive and this was the first food item I've sent back in probably like 10+ years.  Normally if they mess up my food I'll just not come back but both times it felt pretty egregious and for the price point (and the fact that a burger is fairly cheap and easy to remake) it felt like it made sense to point it out.\n\nEdit -  Update - crazy that the owner of the restaurant came on here to reply and just completely lie as well.  You must have some amazing security cameras that allow you to zoom in on the burger I didn't touch and the line cook staring me down in the back kitchen.   Truly a next level setup.\n\nYou are trying to save face because if you look through the reviews there are 10+ talking about how rude the service is and multiple talking about how terrible the burger is.  \n\nI urge anyone reading this review to click on my profile and look at the distribution of my positive vs. negative reviews and decide for yourself.\n\nAm I making this up?  Did I decide to freak out for the first time in years for no reason?  Or did a restaurant hire an insanely aggressive kitchen staff that doesn't know how to cook a burger and the manager doesn't know how to deal with the situation since this review makes them look bad?  You be the judge, fellow yelpers.\n\nPS. I like that you decided to \""ban\"" me like there's ever a chance I would set foot in your restaurant again.

Good drinks selection, everything on the menu looked so good it was difficult to keep from over ordering but I think we did well. For 4 adults and a picky little one we got 2 orders of grilled oysters, some raw ones, tinned trout, grilled calamari, grilled spotted prawns, whole crab, chowder, grilled veggies, the bread pudding, and finally we caved in and got bread (to swipe up the sauces and dippings).  All the food was fresh and nicely cooked, seasoned just right. For grilled oysters we tried the nori miso and got the familiar chipotle bourbon butter, both were good but the bourbon butter is a MUST. The dipping sauce for the crab was surprisingly light I think it had some seafood broth mixed into the herby butter. The bread pudding was a tad dry, though the flavors were good.

I didn't have to trek out to Marshall, CA, to enjoy some genuine Hog Island Oysters. The staff especially our waiter was fantastic. They provided top notch customer service. I ordered raw oysters and they were delicious. 

This was our first time at this restaurant. We decided to sit outside on the covered patio. It had a relaxed chill cafe vibe. Family and dog friendly. Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the different kinds of oysters. I was set on Hog Island oysters. Oh the oysters have a briny sweetness and earthy umani taste compliments of the Tomales Bay and Pacific Ocean waters. But our waiter advised us that the HIO currently are a bit smaller and less sweet. I asked about alternatives  He described the flavor profiles of the other available oysters. I was intrigued with the Olympias he described. But stayed with the HIO sweet waters. They were sweet but not as and less briny as usual. Also softer and less firm in texture and smaller in size. Well our waiter did tell us that was the case. The oysters were delicious. Slurp-licious! We also ordered a side of bread. That too was delicious. It was a sort of rustic batard.

We ordered the following:

$9 - Spankopita Appetizer - fillo dough stuffed with creamy spinach, sweet onions and Feta. - This was DELICIOUS.
$3 - mashed Potatoes for the kids - from the kids menu, the kids loved it
$4 - Cheese Pita - from the kids menu - it was O.K.
$27.5 - Greek Paella -lamb chop, roasted chicken, shrimp, organic sausage, curried orzo - Super HOT- gotta be careful - Large portion, great tasting!

Overall, great food and ambiance. Only issue preventing the 5 star review is the time it took for the food to come out of the kitchen... 15+ minutes.

We were met by Bo and he had told me that he would take care of us, but that being said there were so many people there was no way to be taken care of the wait staff could barely get through much the less any room to spare.  

""Mom"" walked in like a boss, too my arm and said, ""Bo will take care of you"" and then went to the kitchen.    Again everyone was nice, but there was just nothing to do.  Just as I wondered if I should try my luck somewhere else, a lovely lady, Shristy, pushed her way through the crowd with a glass of wine in one had and a tray in the other.

She said, ""take this"" and held the glass of wine in front of me.  I told her I didn't order wine.  She then asked, ""do you want it?""  I did and stood waiting on a table while I drank two glasses of wine.  By the time one table was ready, there were several available.  Again we just arrived at the wrong time.  

I have never figured out why hummus can be so good.  This is my favorite hummus ever.  We always joke since the bowl is always dry by the time the food arrives.  

The pomegranate shrimp was so tasty with slight sweetness.  There is a ton of flavor packed in them.  With the Dolmas the grape leaves are the perfect tenderness.  The felafel were hot, crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.

"cafe-izmir-dallas","""20/07/2014""",2,"Date night and we wanted comfort food i.e. Persian. This came up in our search. We had been really excited about this because of the reviews but it was unfortunately a letdown. 

First we arrived to find no parking - only forced valet. $5 okay.

We go in and after a moment were greeted and asked to wait inside at the bar. After over 15 minutes of waiting we were told that a table would be cleared shortly. However, there had been quite a few tables cleared and ready while we waited. Perhaps we were overlooked by the larger parties that arrived after us? I must still be used to the big city where if you wait that long for a table you are given comp drinks or something. 

We were finally given a table and I will admit it was a nice corner booth. So a star for ambiance. Our waiter came and asked for our drinks order and handed us menus and left. On the menu was a sheet of paper listing the possible items to order. I suppose it is a do-it-yourself theme but typically a restaurant will ask if it is your first time dining at their establishment and will give an explanation of what to do. 

We ordered the plate of the beef kabob (Persian style koobideh), tabuli, side of Moma's rice, and the saffron chicken. 

The tabuli and also warmed pita bread came out quickly. Not bad but I've had better. The side salad from the plate dish was served next - nice seasoning for a side salad. Then the rest of our meal was brought and it all kinda of went downhill from there. I asked for a side of lime - it wasn't brought till I had finished eating. The side of rice didn't have saffron as indicated on the menu. Perhaps I misread? The saffron chicken was spicy and dry. The koobideh I wouldn't call Persian, it wasn't... I'm not sure what spice they used but something they used made us feel sick for the rest of the night.

The restaurant was busy, quite popular though with a definitely older crowd (we didn't see any Middle Easterns dining there...) That can understandably cause a wait as they were short-staffed. However, needing to ask over 4 times for our check and continuing to wait for it to be brought while our server took additional orders at other tables, as well as continued to serve others was annoying. Really slow refills on water too.

"cafe-izmir-dallas","""18/11/2013""",4,"We bought the Yelp deal (great, BTW), and began to enjoy a romantic dinner.

When we arrived we were greeted right away by a very friendly man.

We chose to sit inside as the mood and lighting were just a little bit more romantic. We ordered the Sangria (special on Sunday--YAY!), and as everyone else has said, it was superb. We started off with Hummus and Babaghonoush (sp?). The pita bread was absolutely fantastic and both dips were flavorful and garlicy.

This is where I thought Cafe Izmir could have done better.  While everyone else is raving about the service, I thought there were bouts of inconsistency in their service. It started out very well, but then, after the appetizers, they seemed to forget about us. We were ready to order and seemed like one couple of maybe five in the place. It took them a while to notice were ready to order and the busboy/helper gave me a paper and told me I could order by using the paper and pen, or I could wait for our server. I opted for the paper and pen route, and then the helper took the paper and away he went. From there, it seemed to get better, the food came out (tapas-style, so as it was ready), and it was FABULOUS.

We had the Dolmas; they were spicy (not heat, but SPICE). The grape leaves were tender and flavorful and they held together nicely.

For sides we had the rice and Falafel. Both were great and complimented the meal wonderfully.

The meats we had were the Piroshki and Lamb Rolls. Both were absolutely to die for. The Lamb Rolls come in a tortilla stuffed with a spicy pico de gallo mixture. They are very good and the lamb is oh so tender. The Piroshki's were wrapped in a wonton type roll and deep fried. Very good mixture inside of cabbage, etc.

BEST hummus. Their tabouli was a little lemony the first time I had it, but when I came back, it was right on point. The chicken is tender and very flavorful. I have had both the chicken kabobs, and the saffron infused chicken. I am not a fan of the lamb rolls. It is basically a tortilla with veggies and some shredded meat they say is lamb. The flavor on that was pretty bland. The veggie plate is good. Perfectly crisp veggies cooked in some kind of oil that has a slightly sweet taste. I also had their Greek cake a la mode. I would at least recommend trying it. It is not as sweet as what I am used to with American desserts, but like I said, I'd recommend trying it as well as the other desserts I saw floating around there.

"hog-island-larkspur-larkspur","""11/09/2021""",3,"Everything was just underwhelming... 

Considering it's how popular Hog Island is, out of the 4 locations I've eaten at including ferry building, Napa, Tomales bay, and now Larkpur, the more I think about the more I'm disappointed. 

I came here after seeing it from the freeway and thought it would be a nice place to have dinner. And while it was nice to have dinner, unfortunately the food wasn't anything exciting. 

It's a beautiful location, beautiful weather and the seating was nice. The food that came looked great! Except that's all that was great. 

For the food, I think flavor that made the food good was the freshness of the seafood. 

The crudo was very fresh, but under seasoned and the flavors weren't balanced bordering overly sweet. 

The oyster po'boy was nice. Oysters once again, fresh, flavorful, nicely battered in a light almost tempura batter, not the cornmeal, which was a good idea because the lighter batter highlighted the fresh oysters better. The bread was soft and fresh. The fries, room temp, stale and a bit soft. 

Clam chowder was interesting. It's not the traditional New England clam chowder (which is fine). When I think of chowder, I think of something with a base that is thick. this base was very thin, not even soup thin, but broth thin. The vegetables in the chowder was a nice combination of celery, carrots and leeks. They were cut into big pieces. So big, that some of the vegetables weren't cooked thoroughly. The carrots where still hard and some carrots even were still raw; You can hear the crunch. Some celery were also interesting in texture as some was fibrous. As on the menu, the chowder says it has potatoes and I was trying really hard to look for some, but I couldn't. I think potatoes could have really helped thicken the broth. The clams in it were great and plentiful. 

All in all, I thought it was ok. Not exactly a place to bring kids, but dog friendly tables, quick service and a pretty view in a great plaza.","{""Friends"":118,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/gKYpnZSu7LuL4RA5rcl3QA/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Oakland, CA"",""Photos"":1624,""Reviews_made"":567,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=3cGdYuk314kstQOfSP-c-g"",""Username"":""Leme K.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QAEQeESOiHRyJLqT5Qu3EA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qkThlrO-j3794hAaXbq86Q/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/sxX2NlWIvsPl2ut_77xDgw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/46RouwFq6v4kpcDma9M42w/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":2,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",106,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","Hog Island Larkspur",true
"hog-island-larkspur-larkspur","""16/07/2022""",2,"Hog Island has always been our to-go spot for delicious, fresh oysters and clam chowder, but yesterday's visit to the Larkspur location left my family with a bad taste in our mouths. We usually visit the SF location, but since this one is closer and less touristy, we decided to give it a try for the first time. Honestly, after the terrible service we experienced, our family will probably continue to go to the SF location despite its lines being 3x longer than the one in Larkspur. We were the only Asian family being served for lunch at that time and we constantly felt ignored or as if the waitstaff didn't think we were worth the same amount of hospitality as our neighboring tables. 

Right off the bat, I felt ignored when I was waiting in line to get my name on the waitlist. The host at the time would serve others hanging around the front but never made it a priority to talk to me until I came up and asked about the list. However, when my family came back to be seated, we saw waitstaff being attentive to other customers and asking them if they were waiting to be seated or if they needed to put their names on the waitlist. 

Once our food started to come out, we were appalled by how the staff seemed to just rush to get away from our tables as quickly as possible. At one point, our waitress nearly slammed our calamari onto the edge of the table and briskly walked away without even letting us know what the dish was or making eye contact. Over the course of the meal, it slowly sank in that we were not a priority and we felt as though the waitstaff simply didn't care to treat us with the same respect they showed other customers. It felt especially terrible when we could hear the contrast between how bubbly and warm the servers were with neighboring tables and how cold our service felt. Our family felt unwelcome. 

Despite the service, our family did enjoy our food, which was delicious and of high quality--expected of Hog Island Co. But as an establishment with so many locations and customers every single day, I would have expected Hog Island to train their staff to treat all their customers with the same base level of respect.","{""Friends"":0,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/NLrQfMDn-vCSffREcs8BWQ/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""East Industrial, Fremont, CA"",""Photos"":3,""Reviews_made"":2,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=A9gUoz3mlryGQdEu20tqNw"",""Username"":""Nicole H.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Yp3N7hKNpflnu7PqIBsiqg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/90GvMN_gHaP0IFGxM3lqDQ/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":10,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",108,"","0 check-in","Hog Island Larkspur",true

Cafe Izmir is an amazing restaurant experience at a reasonable price.  The first things I noticed were the beautiful lighting and great decor.  There was also a very talented live musician who sang a wide variety of songs in English and Spanish with his own unique spin to the tunes.

Cafe Izmir is famous for its award-winning hummus, and it certainly lived up to my expectations.  It was tasty and one-of-a-kind!  We got the falafel and chicken kabob platters: both tasty and well-worth the price!  

Our waiter was boisterous and cheery, smiling and cracking jokes--when the musician played one of his favorite songs, he started dancing and singing along with a passion that was fun to see.

One of the highlights of our experience was talking with our busboy, Jose--he was confident and energetic and we had a great talk with him.  That guy is definitely going places!

The sight of people eagerly waiting outside and the aroma of fresh seafood drifting from the outdoor seating instantly caught my attention. Curious and hungry, I decided to make it my lunch spot that Saturday afternoon. Despite a wait of approximately 30-45 minutes, which seemed long at first, the nearby shops and cafes provided a charming distraction.

Once seated, the service was exceptionally friendly and attentive. Every dish we ordered exceeded expectations in taste and presentation, leaving us thoroughly impressed. It's safe to say I'll be returning to explore more of their offerings next time.

Here's what we got:

Acme Bread and Butter (4/5): The crusty texture was a bit challenging to bite into, but that seems to be its characteristic. I would have preferred it softer and warmer.

Po Boy Sandwich (5/5): Absolutely delightful! The shrimp was perfectly cooked and complemented beautifully by the savory sauce. The side of fries was a wonderful addition.

Clam Chowder (4.5/5): This rendition of clam chowder stood out with its lighter, more soupy consistency. Loaded with fresh clams and seafood, it offered a unique taste from the usual thick chowders.

Overall, the experience was superb. The restaurant's ambiance, both outdoors and indoors, added to the pleasure of dining here.

Our table wasn't completely shaded from the sun so I had to strategically choose where to sit and move during my meal in order for the sun not to be shining too brightly on me. The parking lot when I got there was full because it was a weekend and the food trucks were there that day. Still, there were plenty of open spots available, though farther away from the restaurant. 

As for food, I ordered the Market Greens and Two Fish Tacos. Nothing remarkable that stood out to my taste buds personally, but servings were pretty generous. I ended up taking one of my tacos to-go. None of the drinks on the menu appealed to me and they don't have a dessert menu, not even one or two desserts to choose from, which was a bit of a disappointment.

"hog-island-larkspur-larkspur","""12/07/2022""",4,"After the old ""shuck-your-own"" picnic at the original location, the Larkspur restaurant is my favorite Hog Island to dine at. They have plentiful outdoor seating in the usually beautifully sunny Larkspur, with a view of the waterfront and often something fun going on in the shopping center, like a farmer's market or summer movies for kids. I've never had to wait longer than 20 minutes for a table here (though I always come as a couple and can't speak to group waits). I love that they let you have a drink while you wait! Service is efficient without being brusque or like they're rushing you out the door. My only wish is that tables were slightly bigger to accommodate more dishes, since they come out really quickly and it was a puzzle trying to fit and eat from them without knocking something over.

I usually get a crisp Muscadet with oysters, but their cocktails are surprisingly incredible here and not to be missed. The best deal is the oyster shooter: a delicious house mix with some mezcal and ""garnished"" with a fresh oyster for only $10! Obviously from the photo, we went Hog Island wild with our drink order. 

As for food, the menu is creative and you'll definitely spend some time debating what to get because everything will sound and look good (if you're like me and awkwardly look at other tables' orders). The portions are definitely on the smaller side, but the quality of the local and seasonal ingredients are worth the price. Don't sleep on the greens or vegetable sides. The peach and arugula salad is stunning, and the side of balsamic oysters were actually my friend's favorite dish out of everything we ordered. The seafood stew (/cioppino) is the best value main if you really have an appetite. Sadly, we skipped oysters on the half shell because they were really pricy. I would only get them during happy hour (Monday - Thursday from 4 - 6 pm).","{""Friends"":370,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/2netP55pK1YjvMudB5RqVA/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Oakland, CA"",""Photos"":495,""Reviews_made"":861,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=MgAgvJwlt8ujtE4Pr0r9uQ"",""Username"":""Cat N.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/On4E72CczQ27dxCm8uC9WQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VUiYHdeMVXwQErbLzDUpEg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gdFEiiiF3_StcpWGYvp7xA/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":3,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",9,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","Hog Island Larkspur",true

"cafe-izmir-dallas","""13/07/2011""",4,"Greetings again fellow foodie fans.  I'm writing this particular review for one Shristi (hope I spelled it right), bartender at Izmir.  No doubt the regulars know her or are getting to.  I've been to Izmir several times and the service is typically pretty good, but on this Tuesday... yes Tuesday it was outstanding.

I wish there were halves... this would be a 4.5 review 5 for Shristi and a solid 4 for food.  No offense Izmir, it is devine, delicious and excellently prepared.  But I will always have a place in my heart for Cafe Ba Ba Reeba in Chicago/Lincoln Park.  Different as they are Spanish and these are more Turk/Crete; but I digress.

Back to Shristi.  Me and my buddy get there at 5:00 because on Tuesday this place is a nuthouse.  $2 tapas and $14 pitchers of Sangria will do that ;).  Being the relatively seasoned tapas eaters that we are; hummus and tabouleh right off the bat and a pitcher of Sangria to start things off.  Right away, Shristi smiles and knows we're down for the goodness.  Our sangria is right out and shortly behind it our appetizers.  She kept a careful eye w/o being intrusive spotting like a hawk the right time for more pita; suggested delicious items on the menu and even repoured our glasses from the pitcher when she came by.  Incredibly ebullient personality, knowledge and love of the food.  I will *always* ask for her when I get back and I won't be surprised if she knows my name (I'm not going to count on it though ;) ).

Food... excellent as always!  We had the dolmeh, flavorful, right tooth in the rice with a nice lime/lemon finish.  Beef kebob was cooked perfectly and the sumac did it right (suggestion from Shristi).  Its the brown stuff on the table for those that didn't know.  We also got falafal.  Ok... word to the wise here, get this earlier on... oh my lord... it was incredibly tasty but it was like it expanded in my stomach and sopped up all the sangria... woofda!  Lamb wrap was very good too.

Now, after a delicious Turkish meal... coffee is in order.  We already knew we were going to want it and apparently so did Shristi as she just said ""coffee?"" with a knowing look.

Best cup of coffee I've had in as long as I can remember since I left Austin, Tx and lost my Texspresso access...  perfectly sweetened, not too hot and straight out delicious.  Delicious I tell you!!

So, coffee down, I'm thinking Grappa / Uzo or something like it.  Shristi says ""port"".  We say, why thank you I think we will!

Wish I could recall the name of it but it was excellent and closed out the meal just right.  Can't wait to get back there again.

Ask for Shristi y'all (that's Christy with a SH - heh how she explained it).

Oh and value?  Pitcher of sangria, 6 tapas, 2 coffees, two ports... 60 bucks!  That's VALUE!

The Chipotle Bourbon was bomb! Very juicy and flavorful. The raw oyster mix was a yummy sampler to try. Caesar salad was crisp and paired delightfully with the oysters. Ordered a box of the Spanish White Anchovies (olive/lemon) to go. Packed with actual olives and a lemon slice. Both flavors carried through nicely and the sardines were boneless.

"hog-island-larkspur-larkspur","""08/04/2022""",5,"Came here on Saturday for lunch with my brother and our friend who lives here in the area. We brought two of his kids, both boys under 8 years old. 

We were seated outside at one of the picnic tables and it was no wait, really fortunate. 

Billy was our server and we jumped right in. Raw oysters. Grilled oysters, bread and butter, pickled veggies, strawberry burrata. Kids had fish and chips, and grilled cheese. 

Man is the seafood here top level. Mignonette sauce is so good I wanted more oysters just to enjoy more of that flavor! The grilled ones were also so flavorful. Burrata was spectacular but not enough crisps to enjoy the dish...I survived though. 

I had a couple Bloody Mary drinks and they were also done right. I loved the pickles they also were a crowd pleaser- who knew you could get that much flavor into a raw carrot?

There was a farmers market there so we spent the next bit walking the meal off and I got some items to enjoy for the group for the final four and desserts. 

Hog Island does it right. Billy was amazing, knew his stuff, understood our needs since we had younger kids but still coursed us out right for the adults.

View is nice, but I know the ferry terminal cannot be beat for that.","{""Friends"":41,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/IV3ulN4UHcSqIfO9eVQYeg/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""GA, GA"",""Photos"":596,""Reviews_made"":465,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=8cjs9CdbuEHbKQimnFwwVQ"",""Username"":""Patrick P.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7EbkENwQr9Ofb479vqA-MQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cYGjEDqKd7KOMc3QOthS5Q/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xsErLrQqpkZaY7oYWwLa-A/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/TO5LrVHRRf2X2QEh8VRoVw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HyGfDVAIghRfDMOHVs_44w/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""Happy to provide extra toast points for the Burrata anytime - just let us know!\n\nAnd thanks for the stellar review!"",""Date"":""08/04/2022"",""Title"":""BizUserReviewReply"",""User_Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/buphoto/RkJLLxNGgZVeljkuT7YCgQ/30s.jpg"",""Username"":""Lauren B.""}]",107,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","Hog Island Larkspur",true

We then ordered saffron rice, falafels and grilled mushrooms. The rice is regular basmati rice with a touch of saffron rice, nothing spectacular. I expected the falafels to be a lot more flavorful, found them just okay. The mushrooms are marinated in a sweet sauce, good. 

Turkish coffee had great flavor too. Am unsure though if it is common for Turkish coffee to have a lot of coffee grounds in the cup. I got two cups of coffee (yeah, greedy me but in my defense the cups are tiny!) and they both had a fair share of coffee grounds at the bottom.

He loved trying each one and seeing where they were from. When the oysters are presented, they are not labeled. You can determine what they are by following along with the menu, so be sure to keep it nearby. Most menu items are small plates and can be pricey if you order more than one selection.

"hog-island-larkspur-larkspur","""15/05/2023""",2,"Introduction:
So, I recently took my mom out for a Mother's Day lunch at this joint. She was in the mood for some scrumptious oysters, and this place has quite the reputation for serving the best in town. Let me fill you in on the nitty-gritty of our visit, the good and the not-so-good parts.

Atmosphere and Wait Time:
We arrived around noon and man, there was a long line snaking around. We had to wait for about 55 minutes, but it wasn't too bad since we could roam around the shopping mall while we waited. Once we got seated outside, though, it got a bit chilly with that pesky wind. Luckily, the staff was cool and moved us to a sunny spot, but it did take them a bit of time since they were a bit understaffed.

Oyster Extravaganza:
We kicked things off with a dozen oysters, going all-out and trying different varieties. Gotta say, those little suckers were incredibly fresh and tasty. Just one teeny-tiny issue - we encountered a bit of grit in a few of them. It wasn't a deal-breaker, but worth mentioning. Overall, the oysters were a winner and totally hit the spot.

Bread Service:
To go with our oysters, we opted for their bread service. It set us back three bucks, but we got a couple of fresh but untoasted loaves and some butter. Not too shabby, I must say. The bread had a nice bite and went well with the seafood feast we were about to embark on.

Steamed Mussels: Pure Awesomeness!
Now, let me tell you about the highlight of the meal - the steamed mussels. Holy mackerel, these bad boys were out of this world! They came in a coconut broth that was just bursting with flavor. It was like a party in your mouth, and you couldn't resist dipping that bread in the sauce. Seriously, this was hands down the best part of the whole shebang.

Grilled Halibut: A Little Meh
Sadly, the grilled halibut didn't quite live up to our expectations. The first go-around, the fish was overcooked, dry as the desert, and tough to chew. Not exactly what we were hoping for. Thankfully, the server was understanding and got it redone for us. It was better the second time, but still not mind-blowing. The braised veggies on the side were tasty, but overall, we felt it wasn't worth the price.

Service and Staffing Challenges:
Let's talk service. Ugh, it was a bit of a downer, to be honest. They were short-staffed, with only one server running around doing their best. It was clear they were stretched thin, and our server couldn't be with us most of the time. It definitely affected the overall experience and left us wanting more attention. I get it was Mother's Day and all, but they should have anticipated the rush and staffed up accordingly.

Conclusion:
So, here's the lowdown. This place is a mixed bag when it comes to the food adventure. The oysters and those lip-smacking steamed mussels are totally worth a visit. But, gotta be real, the service wasn't up to par, and the grilled halibut didn't knock our socks off. Still, if you're in the mood for some fresh and delicious seafood, give it a shot. Just cross your fingers for better service on a less hectic day.","{""Friends"":1225,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/AjzXN699WeUdqj_qeGWxrg/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Alameda, CA"",""Photos"":596,""Reviews_made"":226,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=5aIEyolTrKm5s49PYqwHyw"",""Username"":""Geronimo R.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tyUs2Cygg6UL_AdxHzKH3A/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FW66Qmz_WwU6oUqfkS7V3w/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JsKmvEGIipbUMeNHybgXIA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1fnlHGANhDq54qNbp6Cv5A/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":3,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",3,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","Hog Island Larkspur",true

Clam chowder: first time having Manila clams (with shells) in the chowder. Novel idea with the freshness you can taste! Non HH item.

Fish sandwich: yummy fish (fried cod) sandwich with a side of fries.

Even on a rainy day, the seafood options sounded amazing. 

Walking in, you immediately feel like you're on vacation on some luxe beachfront. 
The white walls, bright furniture and ocean aesthetic has such a calming vibe. 

We were sat directly next to a pair of couples, when there was a lot of open seating, which I thought was kind of funny - but the energy of the spot sucks you right in. 
It's full of lively folk also ready for fresh food and drinks.

I opted for an oyster shooter, and fish tacos. 
My friend chose the po-boy. 

I did notice the table of couples asked the server how to do the oyster shooter and he sort of laughed and said it's part of the fun (maybe he didn't know either?). 
The ended up asking me, and the only one I've had the oyster was already inside so I didn't have good info for them!

My tacos were tasty, but 2/3 cole slaw as you can see in the photo. 
My friend mentioned her po-boy being about 2/3 bread as well. 

I'd love the food to be just a bit more sea forward! 

I can't wait to come back for a round of oysters and drinks simply to experience the vibe and great customer service once again.","{""Friends"":813,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/TsNJzIYMjHHJcQ_NUyMfSg/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Novato, CA"",""Photos"":201,""Reviews_made"":63,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=oUFevOklF2lgvFZN7K6FDw"",""Username"":""Stina T.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2JbGvSJUm6wl24HPhwS7Xw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/keBO2XwY0RjYiygtbBvQ6Q/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/I30gU926678tYSa6Y4yKUg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ThY07tSsQWN_PKYujg4qaQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/pMS5skxAp5OSwo3XMgYM5A/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OqrgW6s-hmkiiqoqPzVVFw/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""Stina,\nWe appreciate your detailed review.

"zizikis-dallas-2","""15/03/2017""",5,"Oh man! I absolutely love Greece and Greek food. Ziziki's is located in a cute neighborhood surrounded by other restaurants such as Villa O, and this cute French spot that starts with a B. Easy to miss because it's tucked in but what a gem.

Our waitress whose name I didn't get was very friendly and helpful. She recommended the ziziki bread for our appetizer so we went with that. It pretty much looks like a cheese pizza without the marinara and comes with their tzatziki dipping sauce. The bread was good but the tzatziki stole the show. Pretty sure we dipped everything in it and loved every bite. 
My fiancé ordered the Greek paella and I went with the lamb souvlaki. The paella was quite large and beautiful. So many meats on one plate and a great way to taste various meats. The lamb souvlaki was cut up lamb pieces on a skewer served on pita bread with a side of roasted potatoes. The lamb was so very tender and flavorful. I usually order chicken at restaurants but I'm so I'm glad I ventured out from my norm and tried this because it was delicious. The potatoes that come with the dish are also amazing! They are crunchy and seasoned very well. One of the best roasted potatoes I've had and even better dipped in tzatziki. 

My fiancé and I loved the food and service and will definitely find our way back to ziziki's and that yummy tzatziki sauce.

My husband cautioned me against trying it because he said we could only end up being disappointed that it isn't a ""tradition"" paella. Boy was he WRONG!  He ordered his standard/safe Lamb Gyro and seemed satisfied until I couldn't stop raving about the Greek paella, suddenly his gyro wasn't as good as it used to be.  :-)  We ended up adding his shaved lamb gyro meat into my paella and like the good spouse I am- I pretended to not be able to eat it all by myself and he would just have to share it with me because paella doesn't reheat well.  ;-)  If you get the chance to try the Greek Paella, do it!

I'm not a huge fan of mimosas, but their drinks were pretty good. This is a Mediterranean restaurant so their brunch is still Greek-styled. Their pasta was yummy and I really liked their bagels with their cream cheese spread. I ordered an omelette with onions, mushroom, and cheese and it was absolutely delicious. The staff was really nice too and they made sure our mimosas were always filled to the top.

Atmosphere| A great place for a date or a family gathering for a intimate conversations without distractions from todays technologies and enjoying each others company with food that touches the soul. 

Menu| For the Mediterranean lovers, from apps to desert. Mouth watering, flavorful, and entrees that are soul satisfying. My family ordered freshly made Pita bread and hummus, falafel, chicken, beef kebob platters and pomegranate shrimp platters with veggie plates. I did question if their grandma was in the back bc the entrees had the authentic taste.

Recommendation| I would highly recommend this restaurant to others when they want to explore international food. There is not an american twist, 100% authentic even with the staff. The owner, Bo, is amazing individual and great to talk to. He took time to talk to our family for my mom and sisters birthday celebration.

I don't know when I'll next be in the area, but this will be a must-visit spot for me.","{""Friends"":39,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/zXi1Ekezc7BWjW6nvmTYpQ/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Brooklyn Park, MN"",""Photos"":45,""Reviews_made"":240,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=KGS0J7jL_oZQU7McAUuJQQ"",""Username"":""David N.""}","null","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",1,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","Blue Elephant Thai Restaurant",true

You can self park on the street near the restaurant, but for $5 the restaurant offers valet. Most of the group went the valet route. Beautiful outdoor seating! 

There were 7 of us and more than enough food to go around. There were 5 courses that came out, I missed photos of the first and the last, sorry! The first trays were cheesy pitas with some kind of sauce, not sure what it was exactly but it was delish! Then, the tray with the salad, pasta, bagels, salmon, hummus and more pita came out. Next was the traditional American breakfast food - pancakes, potatoes and eggs. Next we're trays of kabobs, meatballs and mushrooms. Last was a dessert tray with fresh fruit as well. If it's your birthday you get a special treat!

The champagne was bottomless (during brunch) and comes with OJ. For a slight up charge you can get peach, cranberry or mango juice as well.

I really wanted to order a lamb gyro but it was $18 and I am not paying that much for a gyro. So I compromised and ordered something else.

My alternative was the chicken gyro that was really good, liked it a lot. Very filling and tasty ($13). The wife ordered the lamb burger ($15) and instructed me to say that it lacked seasoning. Needed salt or something, so it was rather flat. She said Hopdoddy has a much better lamb burger.

The hummus is absolutely amazing and addictive!!!  They have three choices too - regular hummus, chipotle hummus and ""date night"" hummus (which has no garlic - I prefer the regular hummus).  The babaganoush has a great flavor and texture.  The tabouli salad is fresh and tangy.  I am picky about falafel and I just so happen LOVE Café Izmir's!  The veggie piroshkis are soooo delicious!  And the dolmas too!  I've had just about everything there but the last time I went I ordered something I had never had - the grilled lamb chops.  I am sad that I have wasted so many years of not eating that amazing, delectable dish!!!  The outside of the lamb chop was just the right crispiness and the inside cooked to perfection.  Those alone are worth the drive to Dallas from Frisco! 
 
The customer service there is number ONE!  Nick always waits on me there and he is so attentive and helpful, of course any server you get there will be the same!  I used the catering service there once and it was wonderful.  The ambience is quite romantic.  I love the dim lights and the live music in the background.

They have semi-outdoor seating with some indoor seating as well. This paired with live music and lights made for a good atmosphere though albeit a bit loud if you're sitting in their semi-outdoor seating. We were a party of six and ordered four plates: beef, chicken kabob, saffron chicken kabob and falafel. Within the first ten minutes of our order, we received plates of Greek salad and pita. The salad dressing was flavored and was a burst of flavor in my mouth. The warm pita was pillowy, soft and immediately won our hearts. It took about twenty more minutes for our plates to arrive. The meat was served on a bed of grilled vegetables, and the falafel came with non grilled vegetables and hummus. All of the meats were tender, flavorful and out of this world. Since we loved the hummus and pita bread, we went ahead and ordered some for the entire table! All of the food was absolutely delicious and worth every penny. By the end of the meal, we were all stuffed and happy. Our server was also extremely nice, attentive and revealed all of their food was homemade and based on family recipes (expect for their chocolate cake).

I gotta say, the waiter we had that night was pretty cool. He was super enthusiast and seemed like he loved his job. Even though our waiter was great, the service ended up kindna slow as they got busier. Anyways to the food, I really like how this place offers tapas style so I can try more stuff. We pretty much got what the waiter recommended.  The hummus was the best and only thing that was good that night. It was garlic-y, smooth and fine in texture. Most hummus elsewhere is too gritty for me. The chicken, lamb, and falafel were alright at most. The meat was too dry. Even though the lamb wasn't gamey, it lacked the true essence of lamb, and wasn't good. I ended up only eating the hummus with pita bread to get full while neglecting the rest of the food...that's always a bad sign.

We had a Groupon, but the $10 for $20 deal via Yelp with a free hummus for a check-in is a much better deal. With a Groupon, it didn't allow the waiter to enter more than one code for the free hummus. I highly recommend getting the Yelp deal, and might return for a second chance because of it.","{""Friends"":441,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/cWks1fnrhiBggyHeGQMqcw/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Dallas, TX"",""Photos"":1883,""Reviews_made"":623,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=QSkUqUIELyn8guz0fjk9sw"",""Username"":""Nga N.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jyKu62zd1eNnoW3teahFhw/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":8,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":4,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""Hi Nga, Thank you for visiting us at Cafe Izmir, we are so sorry the food you received was too dry and not to our standards, you said you  would give us  another try,  I would love to invite you back as my guest to try out our menu again, we really do try to serve the freshest ingredients and perfectly cooked dishes, I am so ashamed that you  left  unhappy and we didn't realize it, please give us another chance and let me know when you will be  visiting us next, I would also like to refund the amount you spent for the food you didn't like, you should never pay for food that you don't enjoy, that is our policy, and that is how we like our friends and customers to remember us by. please let me know if I can help in any way and hope to see you again at the Cafe.

"hog-island-larkspur-larkspur","""22/04/2024""",2,"Alright, first things first, I hate to have to post a negative review. I came here for happy hour last Thursday after a hike at Muir Woods. I was offered a seat at the counter by the host and agreed to sit there. As I approached the available counter seats, I saw that the counter space was not bused and cleaned and asked staff whether some of the empty seats were taken. No one got the hint so I just shifted the dirty dishes over and claimed the one clean place setting and sat myself down. Immediately after I sat down, one of their regulars sat down to my left and received immediate service by the employee doing the shucking, since it was apparent they were on a first name basis. I wasn't sure who I was supposed to order from so I asked another employee behind the counter whether I was supposed to order with him, to which he replied that someone will come take my order. I ordered off their happy hour menu and got a beer and a dozen of the pinkerton oysters and was asked whether I wanted still or sparkling water, to which I replied ""still."" My beer came first and I enjoyed that for about 10 minutes, while noticing the regulars to my left who got their oysters first even though they sat down after me. I didn't let that phase me until I noticed other tables that sat down and ordered after me also got their oysters, too! The shucker eventually noticed I didn't get my order, acknowledged that I hadn't gotten them, and then started shucking my pinkertons. He apologized and said he added a couple more oysters as a gesture. Not to be petty, but he only added one additional oyster. After finishing the happy hour selection, I wanted to try the Hog Island signature options and it was a challenge to get someone's attention. At this point, some of the unbused dishes and glasses were still on the counter, and I was never given any of that still water I was offered. 

When there's one strike, I usually let it slide. When it's two strikes, I tend to observe if it's going to become a trend. And when it's three strikes, I always find it a mystery and start to wonder why. I love oysters and spent $60 during their happy hour, but don't think I will go back because the service was not attentive.

She was busy but was in front of me most of the time; some check in and asking for us to wait would have been good. I felt ignored. 

Once we sat, it took a while for the waitress to come and take our order. When she did come, no smile, she took our order and never came back to check on us. Amongst other things, we ordered bread; it never came. I had to re-order it half way through our dinner. 

We had two other people bring us food and quasi check on us. I spend a good 20 minutes waiting to see if someone would come to our table so I could order a drink: nothing. Oysters were delicious. Crab roll a little plain. Clam chowder was good. The grilled calamari looked phenomenal but it's tasted like someone dropped a pound of salt. We could not finish it due to how salty it was. 

Overall we were disappointed with the food but more so with the service. For years I've gone to their Embarcadero location which EVERYTIME has been a great time with food and service.

Have been to the other Hog Island in the Bay Area, and our first time here in Larkspur. Oysters are as fresh as they can be coupled with one of the best mignonette I've had. Fish was fresh in ceviche, while clam chowder was a bit different from Oxbow Market. The broth seemed more yellow in color than what we've had, but as as expected clams are of abundance which we enjoyed. Added $2 for artisan bread, and enough to dip in the chowder and to start before we started on the oysters. Was hoping they had the pasta for kids as they do at other Hog Island, but it's okay.

We usually make the pilgrimage to the Marshall location, but I was super pumped to come here since it has a larger menu selection. We elected to sit outside since it was the first beautiful day we've had in a while. The server was nice, nothing crazy. We ordered the caviar and grilled calamari for appetizers. The caviar was great, though the bread accompaniment was too crunchy. The grilled calamari wasn't my favorite, it was a touch over cooked, just a touch, and the flavor was good. My partner ordered the clam chowder and I ordered the risotto. The clam chowder was a bit thin for my preference, and my partner didn't care to de-shell at the clams himself, but the flavor was ok. Nothing to write home about. My risotto though was pretty amazing! I appreciated all the textures, from the English peas, to the perfectly cooked cod, I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. I'd come back here in a heartbeat! Closer drive, better menu, the view parallels the Marshall location. Cute date spot for sure!

"zizikis-dallas-2","""28/09/2012""",4,"The restaurant is pretty causal but the ambiance is very nice, you can still laugh and talk as normal, but still get that romantic dinner experience. 

This restaurant has a pretty good wine and alcohol selection.  We actually ordered a bottle of wine this time since we were dining with our friend who enjoys good wine with his meals.  For a classy restaurant the price for a bottle of pretty good wine was reasonable. 

We started our meal with Calamari, a Greek salad, and a Caprese. 

The calamari was lightly breaded, tender, and well seasoned.  This was standard fare and done well. What was special was the sauce that came with it.  The yogurt sauce was light and tangy.  Perfect with the Calamari.  We decided to keep it with us for extra dipping.

The Greek salad was also what you would expect the ingredients of a Greek salad to be.  The sauce on the other hand was not the usual sour and briny Greek salad dressing.  The salad dressing they use was a yogurt base and good olive oil drizzled on top.  This was refreshing and tasty.

The Caprese was yummy.  We loved the reduced balsamic vinegar.  This gave it a tangy and sweet touch.  Nothing to complain about, good mozzarella, sweet tomatoes, greens on the bottom, and a sweet touch on top...definitely a good start!

Here come the entrees!  Lamb Souvlaki, Stuffed Lamb Loin, and Greek Paella.  Lets just say, they were all delicious!

The Lamb Souvlaki was moist lamb goodness.  You could really taste the flavor of the lamb.  The traditional garnish of olives, tomatoes, and onions paired really well.  The pita bread soaked up all the juicy lamb juice....it was YUM!

Our Greek Paella was gorgeous!  We loved the greek version made with Orzo, it gave it a fresh vibe.  This was a great dish, meats were good, flavored well, and all the components worked together.  The dish was not heavy at all, and you just wanted to keep going back for more.

The stuffed lamb was stunning.   Also a great lamb flavor, but this one is rolled with spinach, orzo, feta, garlic, and onions which made the lamb even more flavorful than normal.  The artichoke sauce was creamy, light, and tangy because it also had yogurt flare to it.  The garnish that came with it was the same as the ones in the Lamb Souvlakis which we were happy about.  Definitely something we will order again. 

Well...our friend suggested dessert.  How can we say no to tiramisu?  So we didn't...we split one dessert.  This was perfect for us three though since we just feasted our way through the menu.  The tiramisu was velvety, rich, and satisfying.  What a great way to end a fantastic dinner and week!

We would rate this restaurant a 8.5/10 for creativity, flavor, atmosphere, and price.","{""Friends"":167,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/280rgLZmdhZWwdt2kf5Zmw/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Fort Worth, TX"",""Photos"":228,""Reviews_made"":46,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=1Imwb5Whkjv0ZfQa4rv7Xg"",""Username"":""Jenny H.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_YQLTWx9TAMbLTMLrUXU1A/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/57I5H9o1BOgPXWXGZU2wAQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CUJJlM4pqit9UnDLAl1AMg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8mePQWmKihH8jPi1V1DNaQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/w6-EfSD1Ob3QVOo55ZuvFw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/YG8QElXZb6mqLiQ4NKXphw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0fvVQaWBti6EMDXP2UGA5A/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Vn5FuO1g8O97jGe6kqx3Iw/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":2,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",108,"","0 check-in","Ziziki's",true

We got the pita and hummus for appz. Then I ordered the beef tenderloin plate and Maeeeday ordered the chicken kabob. Nothing is touching the beef tenderloin! It was perfectly juicy and tender with the taste of some Mediterranean spice rub and the taste of char where it was probably cooked came out of the red meat. Every bite that I took was full of beefy tenderness. The rice was just some wild rice pilaf looking thing and it was served with a grilled tomato, which was good as well.

The oysters get a 5 star with a nice outdoor seating with a view of Mt. Tam and good breeze but improperly cooked grits brought it down. 

We weren't planning on going out to eat, but the idea of having oysters to end our Sunday fun day was a great idea. The weather was good and the sun was shining bright. We both ordered a glass of wine, mine a sauvignon blanc and him, a pinot grigio. Everything was off to a great start.

One oyster down my throat with a lemon squeeze. It was smooth. Buttery. Creamy. Enough to make one's eyes roll back. Shit was hella good. Omg I couldn't believe how delicious that was. I couldn't stop taking photos. Another sip of wine or two. Another oyster down my throat, this time with horseradish and cocktail sauce. Damn that shit could've gone on forever, but alas, all good things come to an end.

Our orders arrived. As I looked at my shrimp and grits, I mentally questioned my order. It looked soupy and watery. I looked at it with a fake anticipation of ""yay, I got my food,"" but really it was ""what the fuck is this watery bullshit,"" but in a Gordon Ramsey accent and voice. The dish looked,  in his words, ""dreadful."" 

My husband felt the same about his order as his risotto looked like watery porridge. The only savior to his dish was his flavorful halibut. 

I didn't have the heart to tell our sweet and cool ass server that the food sucked. Also, I didn't want them screwing with my food because they didn't like my opinion of it. 

Two glasses of white wine, a 12 piece order of oysters, two dishes, we paid $143 including the tip.

"blue-elephant-thai-restaurant-coralville","""10/02/2024""",5,"Believe the buzz around town - this place is IT! Delicious Thai food in a casual setting and hosted by friendly staff. I really enjoyed the Pad Thai with chicken (traditional) at a spice level of 1 (out of 5). It looked like a TON of food (and probably was), but I practically licked the plate clean. The pot stickers were paired with a tangy sauce that give them a little something extra. It was a nice touch. The crab rangoon was also light and crisp. My husband ordered the Drunken Noodles with a spice level of 3 (out of 5) not knowing how spicy their scale gets. From his observation, he felt like he should have gotten a 4, meaning to order a step up in the heat if you are unsure!

Posters throughout the restaurant warned about staffing shortages and chances of dishes taking a while to make, but I would have never known. Our service was considerate, the dishes were prompt, and I never picked up on any stress.

"blue-elephant-thai-restaurant-coralville","""11/11/2023""",2,"We are in Iowa City visiting our daughter who attends the University. We looked up some different t restaurants and thought we would go with Thai food tonight.

We walked in and there was a sign that asked patrons to be patient because they were low on service staff. However, we were given water and had our order taken pretty quickly. 

We were surprised that there wasn't fried calamari, but saw some fresh spring rolls being served at another table so we went with that appetizer. The dipping sauce was a Thai Chili Sauce and not a peanut sauce, which was not what we expected, but my husband liked it better. The menu says it is 2 pieces, but it is 2 long rolls cut j to thirds. Still a little pricey, but it was nice and refreshing to eat.

My husband ordered his usual - yellow curry with chicken. Unfortunately, he was less than impressed. The rice was very dry (didn't even stay together in the little bowl-form). The curry was unusually thick and not much chicken in it. He ordered a 2 out of 5 level of spicy and he said it wasn't spicy at all. 

I ordered the traditional chicken Padt Thai and it tasted like chow mein. The noodles were thin rice noodles, more of a vermicelli than the typical wider Padt Thai noodles I have eaten in the past. The flavor was good, but I ordered a 1 out of 5 spicy level and I didn't taste even a tiny bit of spice either. 

The ambience was a bit bright for a typical restaurant at night. Service was great, but I was a little put off that I wasn't offered chopsticks with my Padt Thai. 

We both walked out tonight unimpressed.","{""Friends"":375,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/8fJL2cLq9EkN_W0rN1ozmA/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Davis, CA"",""Photos"":62,""Reviews_made"":25,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=SSXjs1Wge-EeLb0ThEPLrA"",""Username"":""Pinky N.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gxM7RWVUIm93OuvBEfHdyA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZamgxdOCXjr19bMa1Mnx6Q/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_7p8nutpTjp3lXEhwyTVvg/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",1,"","0 check-in","Blue Elephant Thai Restaurant",true

It was a decision led to a satisfactory night as a result of very flavorful plate of pad see ew. I know drunken noodles could be more ""well known"" and needless to say with your classic pad thai, but you all need to try their Pad See Ew. ""See Ew"" means soy sauce, and this is a sweet soy sauce fried wide rice noodle and the level 3 (out of 5) spicy level to me seemed just perfect. The only reason for -1 star was because the beef was slightly tough and the noodle dish was a bit oily, but given COVID time and take-out being the only option, this could just be a caveat we have to face until at least summer 2021. BUT I still enjoy the dish very, very much and cannot wait to try more dishes from them. I also ended up saving half of the dish for lunch the next day and after reheating it was just as good! One decision led to two happy meals :) Also one small detail was that I am happy they do not give you utensils by default: better for the environment and I really do not need more plastic forks in my kitchen drawer...but if you do need to use disposable utensils you may want to make sure to ask for them.","{""Friends"":188,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/6lta57EiEBvrlzC5oxWD3g/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Denver, CO"",""Photos"":177,""Reviews_made"":70,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=d63GcnuS0S26lodTBd8TDw"",""Username"":""Jennie L.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QwGKxmNRiISLqJ3AT8UaHw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/epvw59uOr_38uSgkgmnCzw/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",103,"","0 check-in","Blue Elephant Thai Restaurant",true

"zizikis-dallas-2","""27/02/2019""",4,"Brunchy brunch brunch!  One of the best things ever invented, especially when bottomless mimosas are involved.

Zikiki's brunch has a mix of standard breakfast fare and Greek food. Fresh fruit, french toast, mini bagels & lox, lamb meatballs, lamb souvlaki, grilled chicken, pita, olives, spanikopita, roasted potatoes, sauteed mushrooms, chocolate cake, rolled baklava, and more are all on the buffet.  Everything I tried was very good, but the lamb souvlaki was without a doubt the item that made the buffet worthwhile for me.  The marinated and grilled lamb was tender, juicy and perfectly pink inside.  

I have to say the mimosas weren't too shabby either.  I'm not sure what bubbly they use but it wasn't overly sweet and didn't give me a terrible hangover like many other bottomless mimosas I've had!  And the wait staff did a good job of making sure we didn't run dry. 

I've seen a few people who think it's expensive but I think the price is fair if you enjoy the buffet properly (i.e. eat too much) have at least a couple mimosas.  It was around $33 after tax and tip. 

Tips: You can book large private parties for brunch.  My friend celebrated her birthday here with 25 people and they provided a private room for us.  Valet is $5 but there is a free self-park garage on Travis Street just north of the restaurant.  You'll need a loooong nap about an hour after brunch so don't make any productive plans.","{""Friends"":510,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/Lc_qWzRcBJahvqCGI9VUeg/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Richardson, TX"",""Photos"":1924,""Reviews_made"":414,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=-DLMAW50HtlHLGruxhFkYg"",""Username"":""Brian Q.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/X9IceUy06-oxLtIPmFxtUg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/S7V2d-WByYguHOdrVnbfiw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XncDXWNkKTL9Gr7Srgzhdw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2aChrT4ohbzRpbwsu93jhA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/W2AGgREp0aWLVCM6_8Ak7w/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/sl8AEXFB5x9oI595RdsyEg/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":3,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""Brian what a great and helpful review!

The hostess walked us inside, and we let her know that our reservation was for the patio. She said there was a 30-40 minute wait for the patio....why even make reservations if you don't have a table ready for that time. We were sat inside right next to the restrooms which was just the icing on the cake after not getting our reserved patio table. We asked the hostess if we could move to the patio when a table opened. She said yes, then we never saw her again. The champagne was brought out first. It was essentially room temp. Each bottle after that was also barely above room temp. The first course was pita with melted cheese and tzaziki. That was exactly how it sounds. Then they brought a platter of salads and smoked salmon and pita. That was fine. Then we got a platter of ""blueberry pancakes"" (one blueberry in the middle) and some eggs that looked like they had been sitting out for hours. After a 45 minutes, the lamb and chicken came out both cold and dry as hell. Why THE HELL did we wait 45 minutes just to eat meat that tasted like it had been sitting out for an hour on a counter somewhere. The dessert course was eh. Chocolate cake and berries and really gross baklava. Basically everything that was cold should have been hot and vice versa. For a group of 5 of us it was $50 per person. I cannot believe I paid $50 for this brunch. I've had better meals at Golden Coral, and that's saying something. The group of 5 of us are kind of serial brunchers, but checking this place out was a complete waste of time and money. You couldn't pay me to eat here again. Go somewhere else! 

I will say though that our waitress was super nice. She didn't check on us enough, but we knew she was super busy. This place was WAY over booked. They should have been turning customers away.

They just ask you what you don't want from the menu. If you want everything on the brunch menu, you get a nice portion of it all!

Truth be told, I drank enough champagne to justify the $33 cost of the brunch, as our delightful waitress Sage kept refilling our bubbly!

"zizikis-dallas-2","""14/09/2020""",5,"Management: PLEASE TAKE NOTE:

I love Zizikis weekend brunch. Especially the outdoor area that makes me feel like I'm in Greece. So many other people do too. Especially a group of over 15 college aged kids who were rambunctious throughout their entire brunch. It was apparently someone's birthday, and every 5 min, they would be very very loud, bang on the table, do a countdown to chug the champagne and mimosas given with the brunch. Every. Single. Table. Was looking at them and looking at each other in disbelief. There were at least 4 tables that complained to the manager about how loud they were at 11:30AM on a Saturday disrupting guests. I really considered giving you guys a low review, as management hold 100% the power to talk to them and kick them out. I saw them talk to the party at least twice, but it didn't stop them from being loud. Management had to come to the tables that complained over three times apologizing for the noise, yet they did nothing about it. I get it. It's a birthday party. We are outdoor, have unlimited champagne, and they wanted to have fun. However, it was completely and utterly disrespectful to the other guests that this party was allowed to still dine OVER AND HOUR after complaints were consistently made.

Management, I get it. You're making a couple hundred dollars from that table, you want them to come back, you don't wanna stir up anything, etc. But I'm extremely turned off on the way you handled the situation. If customers can not control themselves when they are that inebriated, management must step up and kick  them out. No excuses. Even two members of the party must've realized how loud they were because they apologized saying ""they were Irish"" as if that explained away how disrespectful and rude they were to everyone else. 

I give you five stars because everyone, including the servers are wonderful otherwise. They are extremely attentive to (normal) concerns, they fill you up with champagne or mimosas, platters of food, all for $25 bucks a person. An absolute steal for yummy greek food. I've been here three times (once for normal dining and the prices are relatively high, the Greek wine flight wasn't that worth it, but the food was above average) , and we'd like to make the brunch a weekly thing, but I'm not sure I can if I see them handle a situation like this again. 

PS: when the entire outdoor area starts singing the ""Na, Na, Na Na"" song from ""remember the Titans"", trust me, you've got a problem. For the sake of returning customers, fix this issue.","{""Friends"":285,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/5aadaCCGNFaWtTi4klGQwQ/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Dallas, TX"",""Photos"":206,""Reviews_made"":164,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=9fb1LjsbTz_YT81CJLTBRg"",""Username"":""Cyb R.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_GDmtx5WNLH0a2V_LS7geg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/YUKLhNSZZcxg4h-Wzj836g/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":2,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""Thank you for dining with us for Champagne Brunch!

"cafe-izmir-dallas","""29/08/2021""",5,"I moved to Dallas for the first time in late 1994. I was more or less a kid back then, but I clearly remember Cafe Izmir as one of the Greenville Avenue mainstays. Years later, it remains an institution. Clearly, the owners of Cafe Izmir have never lost sight of their roots. The food is every bit as delicious, but it remains a place where one can expect the level of care and compassion from those who work there that one would receive from a beloved friend or family member. I can think of few restaurants that embody this level of genuine care, warmth, and hospitality for their customers. The ambiance exudes a rustic and romantic charm that sets it apart as well, and on the night we recently visited, was perfectly paired with beautiful live music. 

In terms of food specifics, the classic hummus has always been one of the best iterations in town, but the chipotle hummus is almost more amazing. The dinner for two offers flexible choices and is a sensational value at just $65, and the portions are super generous. The beef tenderloin and chicken were both tender and perfectly seasoned. Even the tzatziki is deliciously set apart from everywhere else -- thick and expertly seasoned. You will definitely not leave this place hungry! 

If I could change only a few things about Cafe Izmir it would be these: I do wish they had a liquor license so that raki could be enjoyed, and I'd love to see the addition of a few more classic Turkish dishes such as doner/Iskander, cerkez tavugu, bolu pilic yogurtlu, mantarli tavuk, etc. But even without any of those things, this restaurant still manages to be epic.","{""Friends"":47,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/z_KNv3A6kjvXPFZR7qZGGw/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Dallas, TX"",""Photos"":19,""Reviews_made"":147,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=usMJ2YerUPlMcFmLgiMgUQ"",""Username"":""Kelly M.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/aIUSYcL5rp54f1Eu1kPFPw/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",1,"","0 check-in","Cafe Izmir",true

"hog-island-larkspur-larkspur","""18/09/2023""",4,"Saturday was my first time at any Hog Island location! We visited for lunch and were seated almost immediately on the (dog friendly) patio. I really liked the modern-nautical interior decor, but the ambiance on the patio was great. For drinks, all three of us got Bloody Marys, which were very well made - one of the better ones I've had. We ordered a bunch of plates to share, including the Smoked Trout Roe, Chipotle-Bourbon Grilled Oysters, Cafe de Paris Grilled Oysters, Dozen Raw Oysters, Smoked Trout Dip, and Clam Chowder.

The Smoked Trout Roe was fantastic and came from The Caviar Co, which I love. The bread it came with did overpower it slightly, so I wish it had been served with something lighter. Both types of Grilled Oysters were incredible! I usually prefer Raw Oysters, but the flavors here were ridiculously good. The Raw Oysters were also great though! The Smoked Trout Dip was sadly not our favorite - way chunkier and fishier than we had expected. I didn't try the Clam Chowder personally, but my friend said this one was also mediocre. Overall though, good food and service! The only other negative was the large number of bees on the patio - it was hard to relax with them swarming our table.

It's a smaller dining room, but they do have the outdoor spots as well. Occasionally getting seated can take a while as the host also handles take out and seafood sales. The servers are always consistently kind - even when busy.  The fish sandwich comes with fries that I enjoy, and has a nice combo of pickles and tarter sauce.  Pro move: add a slice of cheese when ordering. I've had the oysters at times and they are always well presented.

"hog-island-larkspur-larkspur","""27/06/2023""",5,"I've been to Hog Island Oyster at the Ferry Building in San Francisco, and I came here because of the great experience I had there. However, this location almost feels like a different restaurant, and in a very good way. It doesn't feel touristy. Rather, the staff feel like neighbors and go out of their way to help you find great seating, food selections and overall a great experience. Brit, Gia, Tracey and everyone were super friendly, professional and helpful. The menu is a bit different from the San Francisco location, and there is even a dog menu.

I liked this restaurant so much that my partner purchased a gift card for me. I misplaced it and contacted the restaurant to see what could be done. The initial response was shocking and disappointing. Among the things the initial restaurant representative said were, ""[it is] not our responsibility to replace a $200 gift card simply because someone claims it was lost,"" ""You only were able to provide us with a receipt of purchase, and unfortunately this does not prove that the card was indeed lost. For all we know the card was used already,"" and ""giving a guest a $200 gift card simply because they say it was lost is not fiscally responsible.""

Lauren B. took over as the restaurant representative, was able to locate payment and balance of the missing gift card, and provided me with a replacement gift card. Unfortnately, the ordeal did not end there. I went with my partner and had yet another fabulous meal, and when it came time to pay, presented the replacement gift card... except, the replacement gift card had no money in it. The people at the restaurant were exceptional and, when we shared our story about the gift card, made things right.

This is a great restaurant with amazing people. Definitely come for a meal or two or more. However, those who are ""fiscally minded"" might want to avoid purchasing a gift card... at least for now and until these problems do not continue to occur. If you still want to purchase a gift card, make sure to save the gift card number in case you lose or misplace the card.","{""Friends"":220,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/bG58vNCXIa32XEbmpQMgQg/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""San Rafael, CA"",""Photos"":16552,""Reviews_made"":970,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=vEKZWbKECFVsMggy_cEnKA"",""Username"":""Kimberly H.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Nd-Kt7KZoA169SBOX1EmOA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/U_2b4n8EmQ0etqpNqr7XtQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BRROhIblBa-AzgUMxmytKQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dyDcRcK5bV1ZGLsE4cHQGA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/B5MfERahhkR7e80iZoRJpQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GHZzh0ZHRvDebFKAbKMqPw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7G_6zu2fqGTBDgMBe4pzow/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CceIAlahU8Z29ol2o70_hw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BGaZjwFFBWF4rLqKsONUkA/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":5,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":2,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":4,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""Kimberly, \n\nAs mentioned in our separate email communication, I regret the signature of my email and I apologize again for the oversight.

As far as I am aware, they never told my life partner to keep the receipt with the gift card number or  warned him what could happen if the gift card was lost.  I understand the risk that the card might be picked up by someone and used at the restaurant, and I think the right thing would have been for them to replace the lost gift card for me.  We've spent more than that at a single visit for just the two of us.  I feel it's also partly their problem that they don't have a better system handling this kind of situation so that lost gift cards can be canceled or better handled.  \n\nAnd ending his reply with, \""Cheers\"" seems like a big FUCK YOU. \n\nI will visit this location again because the staff and food are great.

"zizikis-dallas-2","""18/07/2016""",5,"We were blown away by the quality of food and service at Ziziki's. We visited on a Saturday afternoon around 1:30. The Ziziki's website specifies a menu brunch for Saturday and a buffet brunch for Sunday, so we were very surprised when we arrived to find a buffet all set up! Apparently they offer the buffet on both Saturday and Sunday now, despite what the website says. They did offer us a menu option, but it was a lunch menu and we were interested in brunch food, so we opted for the buffet. The buffet is actually a great deal. For $24.95 per person, you get all-you-can-eat AND all-you-can-drink. Unlimited food and mimosas? Needless to say, we gorged ourselves.

The brunch buffet spread at Ziziki's was truly impressive. Every sweet and savory brunch option you could imagine was available, with a Greek twist. Dolmas, spanakopita, pasta salad, orzo salad, pancakes, stuffed french toast, scrambled eggs, brunch potatoes, beef and chicken kabobs, bagels with cream cheese and smoked salmon, fresh fruit, Greek yogurt, granola, baklava and chocolate cake. That's just a SMALL sample of the many offerings they had available. Everything we tasted was absolutely delicious. I especially loved the baklava, which they make in-house. And the mimosas (which were included and seemingly bottomless) were SO strong and delicious! 

Although it was a buffet, we still were given top-notch service. Our server checked on us often, refilled our waters and our mimosas, and cleared our used plates. She helpfully answered any questions we had and made sure we felt welcome (which we did!). We really couldn't have asked for a better brunch experience.

"zizikis-dallas-2","""28/01/2015""",4,"Brunch Review:

Solid 4.5 stars. Situated inside a little courtyard, Ziziki's is one of the best, if not the best, brunch buffets around. For $20/person, you get access to the buffet, unlimited mimosas/coffee, and a great ambiance. 

Sometimes, when people hear the word buffet, they think of an abundance of low quality food and fillers. Not the case here. The buffet is full of fresh Greek dishes, as well as some American dishes for a more traditional brunch. Sample foods include scrambled eggs (Greek style), pancakes, chicken, lamb, pasta, salads, bagels with salmon and cream cheese, cake, fruit, pasta, dolmades, and really good baklava. Also included with your meal is Ziziki bread. This is pure deliciousness. Think of a cheese pizza without the marinara. The bread is served with their house tzatziki sauce, which is one of the best I've had. 

$20/person may seem like a lot for brunch, but trust me, it's worth it. Other places will cost at least $10/plate, and then there's drinks to consider. Here, you have a buffet of great food to choose from and as many mimosas as you want. If you don't plan on having some mimosas, then maybe it's best to save this place for another time where you can get your money's worth. 

Definitely one of the better brunch options in the area.","{""Friends"":424,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/QMxjlmv4H3dCAN5ImnCwxw/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Dallas, TX"",""Photos"":1773,""Reviews_made"":235,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=zIlmcBCUYhVivWuhVck2Zg"",""Username"":""Eddie C.""}","null","[{""Number"":2,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":2,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",107,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","Ziziki's",true

We bought a Groupon deal and used it for a few tapas. I was honestly not sure what to expect but all of their ""Best Mediterranean in Dallas"" plaques should have been a hint. The hummus was delicious and definitely garlicky in a good way, and the other plates were also amazing, especially the quail and the lamb wraps. Seriously, the lamb wraps were amazing - it was cooked perfectly and well-seasoned. Their house sangria was also nice, and it goes under the category of sangrias with less fruit and more wine. 

The only point that I found was that the table we were seated at had an obvious leak in the ceiling, but being too focused on the food I forgot to bring it up.

"cafe-izmir-dallas","""25/08/2013""",4,"Most of the reviews about Cafe Izmir rant and rave about their hummus. This one is no exception. Overall, this is an absolute gem of a place. I throughly enjoy the atmosphere, the thoughtful array of music that is being spun by a live DJ nightly, and ah yes...that amazing hummus. 

The hummus is like something out of a dream and tastes like heaven. It has a smooth consistency that's served chilled and has cream in it. Served with warm pita bread; you will absolutely drown in this dishes enveloping embrace. All I know is that when I put it in my mouth, I am transported to another realm of happiness. Yes. It's that good. 

They serve a variety of tapas. So really there is something here for everyone. The chicken- is succulent and tender. The saffron rice is delicate and complements the food very nicely. Other highlights include an especially crisp Greek Salad offering and dolmas galore. Mmm...yummeh!

In addition to great meal items, the menu offers up some rather tasty dessert offerings. I recently had a sponge cake with cream that had rosewater in it. I cannot remember what the specific name of it is, but it's pretty magnificent.

The waitstaff is incredibly nice and personable. Every time I have been here it's been a most pleasurable experience.

"cafe-izmir-dallas","""04/03/2013""",5,"It is rare when a place gets everything right.  Cafe Izmir is one of those places. I'm still glowing from a magical evening. I have to say that it is one of the most romantic spots in Dallas. From impeccable service to unbelievable food...it was an almost perfect date night dining experience.  What would have made it perfect? Maybe if they had comped our meal for gracing them with our presence...but I didn't really expect that.

First, let me start by encouraging you to make reservations.  We did not, but I think we just got lucky. We were immediately sat at a very small table for two, and very apologetically told it was the only seat in the house. We found it perfectly acceptable, especially since we showed up unannounced. Not more than ten minutes after we were seated, there were at least five tables on the waiting list.

Second, lets talk ambiance.  Cafe Izmir is very small, but even fully sat with more people waiting at the door, it never felt overcrowded. The overhead lights were dim, but not so much that reading the menu was challenging.  Twinkling strings of white lights added to the romance. The noise level in the bustling restaurant was completely tolerable, and the lovely live guitar music coming from the bar area was at a perfect volume--louder than the buzz of conversations around us, but not so loud that we had to raise our voices to flirt with each other.  The tapas-driven menu is perfect...I always feel like there is something intimate about sharing food.

So let's get to the food.  We started with the hummus (check in on Yelp and it is free!). We passed on the garlic free Date Night Hummus, and threw caution to the wind.  We figured there wouldn't be a problem if we both indulged.  It was a well-calculated risk, the full-flavor hummus was maybe the best in Dallas.  Yes, better than Ali Baba's.  Really. And if either (or both) of us had offending breath, we didn't notice.

Next up was the ground beef kebabs, or Kubideh.  The tapas plate was a nice-sized serving for two and it was excellent.  It came with a bit of ziziki (yogurt and cucumber) sauce that was a nice addition. We also ordered the Pomegranate Shrimp Spicy--five large shrimp over a small serving of rice. An amazing, tart, white wine and pomegranate sauce gives the kick to the shrimp and the rice.  It was a favorite for sure, as was the Saffron Chicken Kabob.  Tender, bone-in, flame-grilled chicken with the perfect amount of seasoning. Yum.

We ordered the grilled vegetables to complement our selections. They were fantastic and we ate every bite of the onion, mushroom, okra, bell pepper, squash, asparagus and pineapple medley.  It was truly a standout.  We also tried the meat dolmas--our server recommended them over the veggie ones.  They were the only sub-perfect element to our meal. The grape leaves were tough and the dolmas fell apart when we tried to eat them. Finally, I'd be remiss if I didn't give props to the bread.  It tasted freshly made and authentic.  No prepackage pita here.

Are you hungry yet?  

As wonderful as the food was, the service was even better.  Our waiter was engaging and attentive, our drinks were filled at appropriate times and even the owner came by our table to make sure we were satisfied.  

All of this and we found the prices to be extremely reasonable.  Even more so with a Groupon discount.

Pass on the risotto....totally unseasoned fish and bland risotto albeit cooked well overall.

Came here on a Sunday evening to get some fresh oysters and enjoy the nice weather. This restaurant hit it home for both of those points!

Staff and service: 
Quick, efficient, and kind. Everyone wore masks.

Food:
- Oysters: we ordered a few different type of oysters. Comes with salt, pepper, lemons, and hot sauce. These were fresh and tasty! I've had some restaurants leave little pieces of the shell on the oysters after shucking them, but Hog Island didn't leave any behind
- Caesar Salad: fresh and crisp lettuce. One salad can serve as a meal for someone or a side dish for folks to share.
- Margarita: tasty and strong.
- Burger: we ordered a burger, but I forgot to take a photo. Split this in half, which ended up being plenty of food with the oysters and salad. Ordinary burger. 

Miscellaneous:
- Overall, great views from this restaurant, especially from the outdoor seating
- Tables outside are a little close together
- Plenty of parking in the parking lot adjacent to the restaurant 
- Bathrooms are around the corner more in the shopping center (not in the restaurant)","{""Friends"":176,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/Szls1IRoaFq5uRChE3z5fQ/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Oakland, CA"",""Photos"":3675,""Reviews_made"":500,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=jn3aR1FUvHsMR0Ip4oIWrA"",""Username"":""Mel S.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8rGCr-wN_gQWHH9IO_jx0g/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/w9ppWzeNrfpushFywsKvUw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/d_-WChMpMwU2obYIUHDcUg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XkaH7zbCwgJcQb3Hv1pqCA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/v8EsE3eiZysFHKQxaD4ifw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/G80R5983Wrla90ihAxp2OA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DV4YH1KHlqGDTKLS50h8Cg/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":2,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":3,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",101,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","Hog Island Larkspur",true

The space itself is gorgeous, inside and out.  But timing in the kitchen is off (an hour between our appetizer leaving and entree arriving) and while we were comped for some of the meal by a savvy waitress, the kitchen was clearly struggling with timing and with hitting the right (flavor) notes.

The clam chowder looked beautiful, but tasted far more of cream than seafood.  The proportions of dairy to clam was off kilter, resulting in a soup that tasted pretty close to warm milk.  Better flavor in the saffron mussels with warm red sliced pepper, but quite a few green ""turned"" mussels arrived that were not safe to serve, which we had to fish out, leaving us feeling like we dodged falling sick from our meal. The burratta appetizer with butternut squash and beets, along with arugula basil pesto & balsamic vinaigrette sounded incredible, but tasted surprisingly bland.

My kiddos inhaled their egg rolls and crab rangoons. (The rangoons were some of the best in the area, for sure.)

"zizikis-dallas-2","""18/08/2024""",3,"I went to Ziziki's to celebrate a friend's birthday with brunch. We were a large group of more than 16 - they were accommodating with the table setup and pretty attentive with filling waters.

The format of the brunch is 'all you can eat' with a 45$ entry for adults, 20$ for kids. This is my main gripe with the place - the price is hefty, and it didn't quite feel 'unlimited' enough to justify it. I think the fact that we were in a large group may have affected this, as it might've been difficult for the server to keep up. However, all plates are served family style, and in my opinion, it makes it a lot harder to get enough of the items you like. Also, the mimosas are limited to one bottle of champagne per two adults. Not terrible, not great.

The Ziziki's bread is fantastic as a starter, it got my hopes up. I tried to order more of it at some point actually, but the server never ended up bringing it. It was pretty difficult to ask for particular things, it seemed like everything was coming out on a schedule and that was about it. Again worth noting the party size here.

I wasn't blown away by the food otherwise. The meatballs were great. The lamb souvlaki was immensely disappointing, probably some of the toughest lamb I've ever had. The chicken souvlaki didn't look much better but I didn't try it. The rest of the platters were sort of assorted greens and other salads/sides, probably typical Mediterranean stuff. 

I don't recommend this place for a large party. Otherwise, if you're very into Mediterranean food, it's a fine (expensive) experience featuring the occasional tasty thing.","{""Friends"":1,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/iNyhP1Yrm2XYrgupTmbHog/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Dallas, TX"",""Photos"":26,""Reviews_made"":13,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Ulz6sK1T1aKEx5GThpuJMg"",""Username"":""Kevin Z.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Np411WQk5f2fb-Kc92okyw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Llcnn6YlrUboObBqKdlmfw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wSHwR_kjAX36-e6KuNFZeg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/NmPEmf0MaMcWIvFP4pxXnw/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",2,"","0 check-in","Ziziki's",true

You'll need a to-go box for all of the portions.","{""Friends"":0,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/7BMvWn9bGufglYBD6_nEaw/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Dallas, TX"",""Photos"":0,""Reviews_made"":1,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=79-i7Mo6N9rLpYpjKYFaOw"",""Username"":""Steve D.""}","null","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""Thank you for the wonderful review, Steve.

Pricing is really great for the food you get (about $30 or so?) They bring out 4 different platters with lots of variety but you're welcome to order anything a la carte from their brunch menu. It includes anything from pancakes, salad, grilled meats, fruits, most with a greek touch. I really enjoyed the food here. It gets quite crowded on the weekends especially during brunch so I highly recommend getting a reservation ahead of time. Because of how busy they were, service was kind of slow but I personally didn't mind because I wasn't in a rush.

We started with the spanakopita. Best spanakopita I've ever had. The filling is super flavorful with a cheese that isn't overpowering. The pastry is very flaky. 

My mom had the Avgolemono, a Greek lemon soup with chicken. Sounds weird but was actually delicious and unique. Super creamy and a hint of lemon. Highly recommend trying! 

I had the Lamb Stuffed Roasted Pepper. The pepper was cooked perfectly, and the filling of ground lamb and orzo was bursting with flavor. My biggest critique is the mashed potatoes were soo dry. The manager brought a side of mushroom gravy which made them 10x better. I might even suggest serving it with this. 

The Greek Paella is also a great dish. It's a really big portion, and you get to try different proteins. 
Even the feta cheese, pickled cucumbers, olives, and onions were so fresh and excellent. 

Our waitress accidentally charged us twice for an extra appetizer, so she ended up comping our spanakopita appetizer.

"zizikis-dallas-2","""05/06/2021""",4,"We went here for dinner last night & had a really enjoyable time! It felt like we were in Greece, with a relaxing dinner on the patio that lasted hours and was filled with delicious foods & wines and great service. 

To start off, we ordered the appetizer board which contained charcuterie, cheeses, dolmades, etc. - I highly recommend it! Every bite on there was delicious, with my favorites being the artichoke hummus (if you don't want the whole board, I definitely recommend ordering this separately as it was amazing) and one of the cured meats that had a great peppery rub on the outside. It was perfect for the two of us to whet our appetites for our meal - it looked like a lot of food at first but it was all small bites and we took our time, so we had enough room for our mains & dessert! 

Speaking of mains, I opted for the Greek platter while my boyfriend went for the rack of lamb. I really enjoyed the lamb souvlaki on my platter (especially in conjunction with their delicious pita bread) but wasn't too crazy about the spanakopita (tasted dried out) or the pastitsio (could use more béchamel - not bad though). My boyfriend's rack of lamb however was a smash hit -- we don't eat lamb super often outside of kebabs so we were curious if the mushroom sauce would pair well with it, and wow, did it! It was SUCH a delicious dish, with the mashed potatoes and asparagus being so flavorful and perfectly prepared as well. 

I'm not sure how we managed to have room for dessert, but we did so we ended up ordering their best-selling baklava ice cream cake. It was very good, and I appreciated that it wasn't too sugary sweet!  

Lastly, if you're going to get some drinks, I recommend to go for their wines over their cocktails. We tried two of the cocktails on their menu and weren't crazy about them however they do have a good wine selection and we were very happy with the glasses we had. The only caveat to the cocktails is my boyfriend did get a really delicious coffee cocktail (off menu) at the end of the meal, so if you're looking for a pick me up, I do recommend going that route! Or ask your waitress for suggestions - we may have just picked two that weren't great but maybe there's other good ones!","{""Friends"":371,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/-wFwxSSDZdCvuLut8d2j6Q/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""New York, NY"",""Photos"":85,""Reviews_made"":168,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=uGJAIka-J09dXj9Avb_WaA"",""Username"":""Amanda B.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ycpPRl6_WRFyOiQtrp8EdA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wBQDMdnUJlvWGGkaipO1XQ/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""Amanda, we are so happy that you and your boyfriend dined with us.

My friend and I enjoyed the dozen assorted oysters   with a little white wine to wash it down. Each selection was either hyper locally sourced from Tomales and Humboldt or carefully curated from other sustainably managed waters. That made their delicate sweet and briny flavors even more enjoyable.

We sat outside to enjoy the view of the ferry landing and although the skies were threatening to rain, we were protected in an alcove on the patio with a blazing overhead heater keeping us toasty.

"hog-island-larkspur-larkspur","""21/04/2024""",2,"Don't recommend for groups larger than 4. I DON'T RECOMMEND COMING FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS--SUCH AS BIRTHDAYS. Came here for dinner, waited about 25 min, and got seated outside at their picnic tables in the parking lot (good if you wanna relive the pandemic outdoor dining experience with no atmosphere/vibes with the sun burning half of the table facing the sunset). I regret suggesting this place to my boyfriend's parents who were visiting from the Midwest to celebrate the mom's birthday.

Service was slowwwww AF, and we also got unlucky because a large party got seated outside with us and the kids were SO loud that we had to yell to hear each other. Because we couldn't get our server's attention, I went inside to get someone else's attention. I asked the employee if we could get moved inside but they said it was unlikely. I also mentioned it was my boyfriend's mom's birthday and asked if they do anything for birthdays. The employee said that they got dessert but don't ""sing or anything"" and asked me which dessert I want. I told him we'll take whatever they recommended and went back to our table. We had a moment of peace from the kids who went elsewhere to play after they ordered their food. 

The food was mediocre at best. I don't know why Hog Island is so popular or if it just doesn't taste as good anymore. Clam chowder is decent for those who want a lighter soup. Grilled cheese isn't good anymore; what happened? Fish tacos were bland. Seafood stew was ok. Calamari spaghetti looked yummy but tasted just ok. 

As we just started digging into our entrees, the server also randomly brought out two of the same desserts... which was a bit confusing because most restaurants bring out dessert at the end??? The lemon ""birthday"" dessert we got was our least fav and most of us couldn't bother to go for a second bite. When our bill came, we noticed that they charged us for two desserts... I wish the restaurant communicated to us transparently 1) that they literally don't do ANYTHING--not even a candle or waiting to serve dessert after entrees (rather than saying that they don't ""sing or anything""), and 2) by asking us how many we wanted--rather than assume our group of 6 needed two. We got one dessert off our tab after the mom mentioned it was her birthday, but the whole experience was such a lackluster birthday dinner.","{""Friends"":1417,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/_VYlCprYMb14boOdcsEgHQ/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Cupertino, CA"",""Photos"":684,""Reviews_made"":874,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Q8BS0HbtMqH295h46UsL7w"",""Username"":""Annie S.""}","null","[{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""Hello Annie,\n\nI am very sorry to hear about this unfortunate dining experience.

Next ...... the most amazing surprise!  The most beautiful tasty wonderful clam chowder I've ever had!

They serve a very delicious Turkish Coffee in the most darling teacup.  It's so delicious!! Never had anything like it before!  The ambiance of the restaurant is wonderful as they have little white lights hanging around the porch windows and the lights are dim.  Definitely a place to try!!

One thing that was a bit annoying was we were left to wait for our check for over 30 minutes without anyone coming by and we weren't able to grab anybody.

"cafe-izmir-dallas","""01/10/2015""",4,"MEDITERRANEAN MAMBA! 

My experience with Cafe Izmir began with their catering, which consisted of many different flavors. From cous cous to lamb rolls to hummus and more, the tastes and flavors seem to dance on my tongue. The food overall was light, but filling, without any overpowering flavors. My first impression was that their food presentation was vivid and lively, with so many colors and different vegetables with their distinct flavors. Easiest way to imagine this is to take an entire buffet and stuff it into catering dishes. SImply wonderful.

And now, the glorious food.

The Food: LAMB ROLL LAMBADA. I tried the lamb roll, hummus/pita bread, chicken kabob, saffron rice, roasted vegetables and roasted hot peppers.

Lamb Roll: HOLY. Don't underestimate this lamb-tacquito-looking wrap, it packs a lot of baked leg of lamb and pico de gallo. It bursts with lamby goodness, without too much of the gamey flavor. The freshness and tartness of the pico de gallo balances the meaty lamb. The lamb roll is filling and is one of the top tapas that they offer. Make no mistake, if you like lamb, definitely try the lamb roll. 

Hummus/Pita Bread: TYPICAL HUMMUS AND PITA. There is not much you can do with hummus and pita, except to infuse strong and complex flavors. Here, the hummus looks literally like beige-colored blended chickpeas without any additional color or herbs/spices. The hummus and pita bread were plain compared to all the other flavors that Cafe Izmir had to offer (-1 star). 

Chicken Kabob: Chicken goodness. Marinated and grilled in their spice blend termed Izmir spices. Chewy, but tasty. The spices gave the chicken a flair, even though the chicken was in between moist and dry. Overall, the spices gave it flavor and I live for the flavor of chickeny goodness.

Saffron Rice: Simple basmati rice with saffron-infused flavor. Pairs well with the chicken kabob and lamb roll, as well as the char-flavor of the roasted vegetables and hot peppers. Great palate cleanser and highly recommend over the pita and hummus.

Roasted Vegetables: BBQ VEGETABLES. Broccoli, bell peppers, and onions in a roasted vegetable medley. Drizzled with the perfect amount of olive oil such that the vegetables retain their natural flavors, as well as the gift that roasting provides them. Can stand alone as a solid dish and main entree for vegetarians.

Roasted Hot Peppers: Spicy, tangy, and charred flavor that provide an edge to Mediterranean food. These peppers are serrano peppers, so they add a bit of unexpected heat, but really goes well with the spices and flavors of Cafe Izmir's Mediterranean cuisine. The flavor is less intense compared to jalapenos and due to the roasting, but it adds a sweetness cut by spiciness. Wonderful.

The Verdict: THE FLAVORS KEEP DANCING. 

Overall wonderful flavors and balances between meat and vegetables, and spicy, salty, and sweet. The lamb roll is a must try: light, meaty, and refreshing. I'd skip the typical plain hummus and pita, and go for their saffron rice and/or flavored hummus. The roasted vegetables and hot peppers can stand alone as a dish, but they pair very well with the Mediterranean spices and dishes. Definitely try Cafe Izmir and you'll remember the savory dance on your taste buds.","{""Friends"":489,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/jdxpIH1utm_ryctsVsxc7A/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""El Paso, TX"",""Photos"":312,""Reviews_made"":165,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=DooN-gRzhAdZgmJK2NfdpA"",""Username"":""Vic F.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ItDYooyCHDFPzVcEzqagdw/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":2,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":3,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",108,"","0 check-in","Cafe Izmir",true

They are nestled next to a pizza place that has the majority of the parking spaces so you have to valet. Which is fine... Just tip well!  Now on to the DELICIOUS  feast we had: Beef Dolmas,  Marinated Olives,  Hummus (you can get garlic-free for date night),  cheese and fruit plate,  and Beef Kabobs with the Tz-sauce ( can't spell or pronounce the sauce name),  and Saffron rice! We washed it down with a California Pinot Noir-a great compliment to all the flavors of the Mediterranean!  I didn't have room for dessert but that just gives me an excuse to visit Marcello again! They do have vegetarian options but I didn't see vegan or gluten-free options but it doesn't hurt to ask if they can accommodate. Marcello was a gem and I think he would try to fulfill any reasonable request. He even honored a check in coupon that was expired but still showed. How cool is that!

We went last night for cheap tapas night.  I arrived first so they didn't seat me, but let me grab a seat at the bar, so I went ahead and ordered a bottle of wine.  When my friend arrived we were seated on the patio and ordered the magical pita and hummus to start while we looked over the menu.  You can basically make a meal out of the pita and hummus, and by the amount of leftover food we did.

Service is spot on.  The same people have been working there as long as I can remember, and are just as friendly and helpful.  This place still gets super crowded on Tuesday's, but these folks have the system down with moving tables for smaller or bigger parties.

"cafe-izmir-dallas","""01/04/2014""",4,"Okay, like all the cool Dallas eateries, this one has been reviewed to death. So I'll spare you the details of how my meat and humus was seasoned and just get to the nitty gritty.

1. Lotsa people are on here complaining about the valet parking. Yeah, so the lot ain't that big. But have you tried parking, I don't know, ANYWHERE in Dallas? I work at Parkland (the Dallas County hospital for you outta towners) and STILL have to pay to park! Oh, and take a bus to get there once I arrive. So the valet isn't a star-killer for me.

2. The waiter will try and sell you the ""family style meal."" Just don't. It's not bottomless, for one. For another, I went with about 6 people and there simply wasn't enough of everything to go around. I had to order falafel à la carte just to try a piece. For anything more than 4 people, insist everyone get their own orders. You'll get what you want, AND it will be cheaper. This was a bigger crime than the valet parking.

3. And as multiple people have pointed out before me, this is a great place to celebrate a birthday.

"hog-island-larkspur-larkspur","""27/09/2022""",5,"I had the craving for Oysters, and since this month is the first month to end in -ER in quite a while, I decided to go to one of the best places to get oysters.  Hog Island Oyster company.  ( I was told to only eat oysters during months that end in ER ( Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec )

I looked up all the locations they had and I decided to go to Larkspur, I didn't feel like going to the city so I drove all the way to Larkspur.  It's not an oceanfront place but you can see views of the Larkspur ferry terminal and the water around it.  I also chose this location because the prices were fair.  Some places charge upwards of $4 an oyster.  Since this place grows them I figured they would be the freshest.

Ambiance : We walked in on a Friday evening at around 7 p.m. and were able to get seated inside the restaurant without waiting.  If we wanted outdoor seating it would have been a little bit of a wait.  Perhaps 15-20 mins.  I didn't want to wait, but in hindsight I should have waited as the inside was pretty hot.  It was about 75-80 degrees outside in the evening.  Even with the windows open I felt a bit uncomfortable, but I dealt with it because I was there for the amazing food.  There is a nice bar you can sit at, but we chose table seating.  The place is nice and bright with windows all around.

Service : Upon being seated we were immediately greeted by our server.  He was knowledgeable and recommended some of the items on the menu.  He also uncorked our Champagne bottle for us, gave us 2 flutes and later on he put it on ice which was a nice touch.  Very friendly and attentive service on a busy Friday evening

Food :  Appetizer - Acme Bread w/ Butter  
The Acme bread was hard and kind of chewy, but I guess that is how it is supposed to be.  I wanted something bready to eat after the oysters to cleanse my palate, but it ended up being chewy crust and very little of the bready goodness.  It would have been nice if the bread came out warm so the butter could melt nicely.  

The House Made Pickles - had a vinegar kick on the back of the throat and it looks like it had either Turmeric or curry flavoring as they were yellow.  The curry or turmeric was not expected as I wanted something fresh, but it ended up being spicy like a chutney pickle to me.  

Oyster Bar Mix - We chose the mix of 2 of each oyster, they came out nicely plated in a clockwise direction starting at the lemon from the top of the oyster menu so you knew which one you were eating.  I loved each and every bite, I squeeze lemon on mine with a splash of the Hogg Island Hot sauce.  The first 2 were local Hog Island Sweetwater from Tomales bay,  6 were from Washington Totten's (WA), Hammersley ( WA) Pickering of Passage (WA) 2 were Dukes of Topsail (NC) and the final two were Valley Pearl (Prince Edward Island).  The flavors were of Cucumber, Canteloupe, and saltwater brine with Umami.  2 of them were creamy, but not big and bloated like some other oysters that inflate and taste creamy.  I like creamy but don't like them big and bloated looking.  I like to see them flat.

Fish Tacos - This location has the Alaskan True Cod unlike the SF location which serves Rockfish.  Nothing wrong with that, but I like the flakiness of the Cod better.  The Cod was deep fried perfection layered with slaw and chipotle crema, then topped with sliced avocado.  I ate everything but the corn tortilla, 1 because I was watching my carbs, 2 because the corn tortilla was not heated up or toasted at all, it seemed just straight out the bag and onto the plate.  I like mine toasted or heated a little.

Steamed Mussels - Tasted great, wife ate the whole plate.

Drinks: We brought our own bottle of Rose champagne and it went lovely with the oysters.  I appreciate the waiter making it feel special by uncorking and pouring into flutes, and icing the bottle.  

The 5 Star review is based on the Oysters and the service the only three things that I didn't like were the bread, the house pickles and the cold corn tortilla.  Other than that they deserved 5 stars, it is hard to be perfect in all aspects, but if your here for the oysters it will be a 5 star experience.

Most of my reviews will probably be 5 Star Reviews unless something went wrong, tasted funny, or if service time was long.  I only tend to frequent 5 Star establishments thus the 5 Star Reviews. 

Pro Tip : When looking on Yelp I sort by Most Reviewed, I figure if a place has been reviewed alot it must be good or very popular for a reason.","{""Friends"":37,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/HYuqYwCLSEE2ReWGTmVoAw/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Livermore, CA"",""Photos"":204,""Reviews_made"":48,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=8_4V_5O_P0AW3alPamMYZQ"",""Username"":""Faoud K.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RMRHNG7rixIa0pmRkTBePQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Ej9zCzUXMv5mEfllTnFnfg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kLMf4WkgYbFICtctg3gzsg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/z05PTHMo-7lcLPpm6SKaMg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VYwcDTEEyDplKcCaOdqFjQ/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",104,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","Hog Island Larkspur",true

I always get the clam chowder and let me tell you I didn't know it could be so good! It's insane and absolutely the best chowder of my life. It comes with clams in the shell and the broth isn't thick and gloopy but thin, rich, and buttery. Make sure to get some crusty bread to dip in. I believe it is acme bread. 

It's a casual ambience since this location is near an outdoor mall. It's also by the water so you can get some glimpses especially if you sit outside. If you want a quick bite you can always eat at the bar. There are usually open spots. The decor is fresh, white, and blue. It is nautical themed but manages to not be kitschy.

Case in point- when they were about to expand the wine list to include new Greek wines, we had an in depth discussion about them; she knew a lot about the various regions and what they produce. (I lived in Greece when I was younger and my father was an oenofile, so *that* was a fun chat!)

I love Hog Island oysters and had thought of making an outing into the city to visit the ferry house location, which I had been to a couple of times. You can take a ferry from here into the city, the ferries are right by, not sure if they are running because of COVID.
I pulled over and parked, this spot utilizes a large section of the parking lot for an outdoor seating area. It was packed! But the good thing about going on adventures alone, it is easy to get in. I ordered grilled oysters, and couldn't decide which flavor I wanted, so the waiter suggested one of each. I also ordered a dozen of the raw, small sized ones. I am sorry, I ate them and forgot to take a picture. I can say, oysters from here are amazing!! There is really NO comparison. Once you have oysters from Hog Island, you cannot , well its really hard, eat oysters from somewhere else. It's nearly impossible! Hindsight, I should have ordered the chowder too. It is so good.

"zizikis-dallas-2","""05/01/2013""",5,"This is absolutely the best Greek restaurant  to dine at in Dallas and my personal favorite!  I dined  here on a Friday night with a friend who was new to Dallas and a big fan of Greek food. As I expected, she also became hooked on this place and was thankful for my suggestion. 

For our appetizer, we had the Spanakopita. It's a flaky dough pastry filled with spinach , onions, and feta cheese and served along with olives, sliced onions, and Roma tomatoes. The ingredients were a perfect combination for flavor and texture. If you want to prolong the enjoyment of the Spanakopita, I suggest ordering it for yourself or sharing it with no more than 1 other person due to the portion size.

For the main entree, we ordered the  Chicken souvlaki. Let me tell you, Ziziki's is VERY generous on the portion size for the Chicken Souvlaki. Both my friend and I wanted to share that entree and expected for only one gyro to be served. BUT when the dishes came out with our food split, we each had our own gyro and roasted garlic potatoes. It literally looked like one meal size for a ""shared portion"". So if you're hungry and you order the Chicken Souvlaki expect to see 2 gyros. Otherwise, if you want to share, this portion will leave both parties very full and happy.

Another small treat I liked about this place is that they offer free Andes chocolates in the bathroom! If you love Andes, be sure to grab some. (Sometimes the little things  in life do matter you know!) 

Note that Ziziki's location off Knox and Travis is hidden in the complex. When you valet or park your car, you'll have to walk further into the plaza to find the restaurant as it is not visible along the street. Also, the service and atmosphere is pleasant and trendy inside, so immediately you have a very good first impression..

"hog-island-larkspur-larkspur","""19/08/2022""",1,"I've been a loyal Hog Island customer over the years and have visited several locations including the Larkspur location. Last weekend I treated a few friends  who were visiting from out of state to lunch at one of my favorite oyster restaurants. Our waiter was Jason;  he was very friendly however he was quite delayed in checking on our table. I also felt swindled and upsold by what he suggested was a mistake but I feel like he was just taking advantage of the situation to increase the overall Price of the bill. I think he could tell that some of the people on my party may have had trouble itemizing the bill due to English not being their first language

I ordered a mixed green salad with an add halibut which should've been $23 what he brought was a mixed green salad and an entrée order of halibut which totaled $42. We explained to him that we did not order the entrée and he was apologetic he stated that he would provide the entrée for free and also send out the add halibut for the salad. He actually ended  up bringing ANOTHER  salad with halibut on it but when our bill came he charged us for 1 mixed green  salad $8 , one mixed green salad with add halibut $23, AND the halibut entree $34. We raised our concern to his attention and he apologized once again said he would take it off however he only subtracted $8 which would've been the add halibut from the salad.

We got there at 10:45am on the side of the restaurant facing the big outdoor tent where we lined up the last several times we were there to be first in line for a good outdoor table. We saw the staff having their morning meeting and they saw us there early, waiting. When the restaurant opened, we noticed they were seating people who showed up after us from the other side of the restaurant. I told the young man seating people that we were here first and he said you need to enter from the other side. He could have checked with us to see if we were there for lunch at the restaurant before seating the other people. He then pointed out that there was a sign on our side, that we didn't happen to see, saying to enter from the other side. Like it's our fault we didn't notice the sign. Then we walked over to the entrance and he walked us out to tables. The two of us asked for a four top as we had in the past and he replied emphatically, No! And said I can seat you at this two top or the one around the corner which he showed us. When we said we'd like the first two top we saw, the other female seating tables had already seated a woman there and our young man said, we'll I guess that table just slipped away from under your feet. I felt like I was at McDonald's or something having to make sure I knew all the rules of where to stand without staff giving us any benefit if the doubt. We weren't getting anywhere with this guy so we decided to just leave. He could have been gracious and just given us a four top but he made us feel like it was our fault and our mistake that put us in this situation. We were just looking forward to Hog Island's great clam chowder and oysters but the customer service from this young man was so deplorable that we didn't even get to the food.

The Kumamoto oysters were sweet and tender and amazing with the vinegar sauce + lemon! Priced at ~$20 for half a dozen, these are not cheap, but well worth it on occasion 

The chipotle bourbon grilled oysters were unlike anything I've ever had before!! They were sweet, Smokey, and still extremely tender - I'll be dreaming about these oysters for the next few months  Priced at $17 for 4 I believe 

The market green salad was great, with a homemade vinegrette sauce. I especially enjoyed the butter green lettuce 

The broccolini with red pesto was good, slightly charred and covered with sauce. I did think there was too much sauce and it was a bit too acidic
 
The fries were pretty standard, definitely overpriced at $6

The crudo was interesting - they used a blackberry purée at the bottom and added pickled shallots. The fish was hard to cut and pretty stringy. The dish was not very flavorful, it needed some acid or citrus. I couldn't actually taste anything from the blackberry purée. Wouldn't get this one again

All in all, definitely a great place for a special occasion.

Sign points inside for takeout.. Waited by counter to pickup order, and was met with extreme attitude by staff member with brown curly hair....

""Excuse me (insinuating I was in her way)""

Maybe don't place the plate settings you have to pick up from right next to the pickup area you've designated. A new system is encouraged 

Will make sure to give zero tip next time picking up from this Hog Island Oyster location

UPDATE same day: 

Hog Island Oyster some more feedback for you..... Maybe for dishes that may consist of fluid, take more consideration of your packaging! The Pescatore dinner for two was packaged in a card board box in a paper bag. Needless to say my car is interior is destroyed because the fluid from the meal seeped through the cardboard box and then the bag. Pretty unfortunate... see pics 

I suggest packaging meals like this in a plastic container? Could be wrong

"hog-island-larkspur-larkspur","""21/10/2020""",5,"Was craving oysters on the way home, and stopped by for some take out. Just from the look of things before even getting inside, I could tell covid-19 was taken very seriously and all the precautions were in place. I noticed an outdoor dining area with all tables separated at 6 ft apart, and that they didn't have customers sitting at tables next to each other. As I walked closer to the take out door, there was a huge sign about saftey with great humor. 

Immediately I asked if they had Kumomoto Oysters, and to my delight they did. I decided to take a dozen, and also a dozen extra small Pacific Oysters. I then realized I would need some warm food to go with my little gems. Ordered the Grilled Halibut sandwich and the crispy Halibut sandwich, with an IPA. All the oysters were packed with ice for the ride home, and warm food in a seperate bag. They had them waiting in a basket to minimize contact too. 

Upon consumption, I noticed how beautiful and fresh these oysters were. Obviously brought in that day. I had a shucker at home so was ready to go. If you don't have the tools and gloves at home, they offer them for sale too. Topping off some of the oysters with the Hogwash mignonette adds just the right amount of acid from the rice vinegar they use. 

As for the sandwichs, I recommend going for the crispy vs the grilled. I had to order both to do a comparison, and found the grilled to be a little on the dry side. Now if your thinking crispy is going to be unhealthy and only, think again. The batter wasn't oily at all, the fish waz so juicy, and it was backed with the right amount of flavor being beautifully topped off with a basil aioli that just melted into the bread. 

So your asking how much do these guys pay attention to detail? They ketchup that accompanied my fries was the shocker. The ketchup is homemade. This isn't your in the bottle ketchup. It was textured like a tomato was just pureed, and not heavily salted!

Hats off to you all for doing such great work, care, and understanding, during this pandemic. You allowed me to shuck oysters at home and pretend I was at Tomales Bay.

"hog-island-larkspur-larkspur","""08/07/2020""",4,"Covid-19 Review: Literally pulled off the highway after my husband spotted ""oysters"" and knows how much I love them. It's in a plaza with other cute shops. We are not from the area and were coming back from a Sausalito stroll. They were open for dining and had a large outdoor area with tables spread out. The servers were wearing masks. We only wanted take-out, and there wasn't a line when we got there around 2:30 pm on a Thursday. I really had a craving for oysters, and asked the girl how it worked with shucking. She said you would shuck them at home and that they sold the shucking knife for $18. A dozen oysters are $25, so I would be paying on top of that for a one-time experience? No thanks. They also sold gloves, and I didn't bother asking how much those were. I asked if a regular knife would work and she said no, that they are much too thin. I have only eaten oysters in restaurants, so what do I know? But I did know that I didn't want to pay ~$25 for tools to eat $25 of raw oysters, and I don't even live in the area to get oysters that often. Ordered the claw chowder for $17 and it was raging hot! Even after a 30 minute drive home, it was still hot enough to eat and there were 27 clams in there!! This is not your traditional goopy clam chowder, this is the real deal with veggies and tons of clams, with a more clear-like broth. It was soooo good and for $17, it was worth it. The cashier and people there were really nice. It's no-contact and the woman who put my order in one of the 4 bins made sure to put on her mask and gloves before handling my bag. I guess this is a new location, so will probably go back on our next trip up! I didn't give it 5 stars only because of the crazy markup on the oyster shucking knife! Checked on Amazon and they go for half the cost, but I guess they can charge those prices for that area, especially if customers plan on going back for their fill on raw oysters.","{""Friends"":1201,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/n5dH4TmOCM28JJZdFrogTw/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Irvine, CA"",""Photos"":618,""Reviews_made"":1090,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=36Vr9BASkR2v9NKNoZtiSA"",""Username"":""Ming-Jou C.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Q6t5BO2JgTXl6qP5diKQsA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-RMcsEJIY1Ogx9xJSLsJEQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PS2geMrp7x3pLy0coFEY1g/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":4,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":4,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",301,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","Hog Island Larkspur",true

"cafe-izmir-dallas","""01/10/2010""",5,"I have been going to Cafe Izmir since 1999.  YES TEN YEARS!!!... and the food has remained consistent all these years.  The portions are Mediterranean tapas sized and sharing is encouraged.  The hummus is amazing, extra garlicy... they recently added a ""date night"" hummus for those who don't want to smell like a garlic farm.

Tuesdays nights you will find reduced priced tapas.  If you are willing to wait, its worth it.  Be patient and don't throw a fit, just enjoy the wine and the company you are with.... AGAIN you might wait for an hour for a table depending on how well you treat the staff... The nicer and pleasant you are, the faster you will be served. DON'T GO ON TUESDAYS IF YOU ARE IN A RUSH.

Fridays nights have a date night menu.  Its a pre selected meal with a bottle of wine.  Its more than enough food for two people, and you are welcomed to add more dishes (ie the hummus).

Besides the hummus, I like the beef kabob and the priakshi.  The chicken kabobs are a little dry for me.  the food is served quickly once ordered starting with cold dishes followed by the hot dishes.

The staff is hit or miss... some of the servers are extremely pleasant, and others seem to be stand offish... but the will diminish as you ask them more questions and just make small talk.

All in all this place is heaven to me, and if they ever close, they might as well take my life... that's how much I like it!","{""Friends"":19,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/6BoXIHPqdhj5PpYzTdMAAQ/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""ASTORIA, NY"",""Photos"":0,""Reviews_made"":11,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=frpy3SjKljgidG38ABXYBg"",""Username"":""Viren P.""}","null","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""Viren\n\nThanks so much for the wonderful review, we hope to see you again soon. \n\nYour friends at Cafe Izmir"",""Date"":""05/10/2010"",""Title"":""BizUserReviewReply"",""User_Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/buphoto/GhESDlmyvtLsCZCm1yAsEA/30s.jpg"",""Username"":""Beau N.""}]",404,"","0 check-in","Cafe Izmir",true

The vibes are so nice from inside, I like the decor and the colors, mostly white and blue, great for date fun night or for friends gathering! You can sit inside or outside.

Busy restaurant for sure. 

The food was so so good, nothing we ordered was not good, everything was yummy! 

Our order was: 

Seafood stew: 
Full of seafood and the soup was great and delicious, good amount, the only thing I felt not fresh is the shrimp or maybe they overcooked it, but other than that was great dish! I recommend to order bread to eat it with the soup so yummy! And the bread they have so good! 

Sardines: 
Was yummy and juicy, I love sardines and i like the toppings on the sardines, just be careful there is nuts if you are allergic! 

Grilled calamari: 
My favorite for sure! Definitely I will order it again, so fresh and tasty and the sauce was perfect! Lemony sauce. 

Oyster drink: 
Well I am not a big fun of drinks usually, but I liked this one! Eat the oyster first then drink it! Yummy 

All in all was lovely experience, plus customer service was good and nice, our waiter gave us good recommendations! 

Parking not that hard around this restaurant.

My party arrived at around noon on Wednesday and were seated right away. We had a choice of eating at the picnic tables under the canopy next to the water or the single tables by the building. We opted for the single tables by the building. 

My favorite item ordered were the assorted oyster. We ordered a dozen. My favorite was the Kumamoto oyster, the oysters were all really fresh and juicy! It did not disappoint! 

I also tried the clam chowder. This is a true, hearty chowder! There were plenty of fresh clams, which adds the delicious seafood flavor to the chowder. In addition, the bacon and veggies adds good texture to the creamy broth. It was delicious and felt warm on a windy, but sunny day. 

As for the fish tacos, they are solid tacos. The breading to the fish was seasoned very well and was fried perfectly with the right amount of crunch without being overly deep fried. The slaw on the top gave the taco the fresh taste that the taco needed. Again, it was a solid taco!

"cafe-izmir-dallas","""25/03/2016""",4,"A wonderful fusion of Mediterranean and Spanish cuisine. 

I came with some friends in search of some good food and I wasn't let down.

I really enjoy the atmosphere, even though its a really small space. The night I was there they had a Spanish guitarist playing at the bar. The outdoor patio is well lit and sets the ambiance for a good night. Kudos on the interior and exterior decorations

They serve everything in Tapas, so my friends and I ordered a lot of things and shared it. We ended up getting regular hummus with pita bread, chili pepper hummus, falalfel, a sweet potato, dolmas, and pirashki. The chili pepper hummus and pirashki were definitely the highlights of the meal. The pirashki have a nice texture and have a great bold flavor on the inside. The chili pepper hummus is a little spicy, but its quite addictive after several bites.  The pita bread had some chew, but it was quite soft and moist. The falalfel had great flavor but I wish it was crunchier. Albilad I think makes the best falalfel in town, but Izmir still has a great foundation in flavor. The dolmas were also good, but I wish it wasnt so chewy for the grape leaves. The sweet potatoes were nothing special, but I still enjoyed them even it was simply steamed. The regular hummus was good, but the uniqueness of the chili pepper hummus outweighed it halfway through the meal.

"hog-island-larkspur-larkspur","""03/04/2020""",5,"Opened just last week, Hog Island is new to Larkspur, but this super popular San Francisco-based restaurant has been thriving throughout the Bay Area and Sonoma counties for years with five restaurants now.  This one is another winner!  

It's way beyond challenging to open during the COVID-19 crisis, but these guys are doing a great job!  I appreciated that they even sanitized​ their pens and had one cup for clean pens and another for used pens.  I haven't seen this done anywhere else!  They should share best practices. You can't be too careful these days.

This location features some menu items you won't see at their location in the Ferry Building, like the Cali Hali Club (yes!!), Shrimp Linguine and Spiced Rainbow Carrots.  

***Cali Hali Club ($19.00)***
Ahhhmazing!!!  5/5, hands-down​!  The halibut was incredibly moist and ​served inside an incredibly soft, fresh and perfect bun that held up well with a nice texture.  It also comes with two slices​ of thick crispy Hobbs bacon (I love Hobbs!).   I'm generally not a fan of bacon in sandwiches, but I really enjoyed this combo because of the thickness and crispness​ of the bacon.  And, hey, Hobbs is quality stuff.  There's also a good amount of avocado and the ingredients were all well-proportioned with the bun.  I could easily have this a few times a week and be a happy camper.  

***The Burger ($18.00)***
If you're craving a good hearty burger, get this!  They're made with the same amazing buns that the Clubs are.  The beef was prepared medium-rare and as with the Club, the burger is also well-proportioned.  I love a solid burger and I'll be back for this too.  

***Tacos ($17.00)***
Served as two tacos with cod and generously stuffed with pickl and topped with guac.  These were okay, but pale in comparison to The Burger and The Club.  

***Grilled Cheese Sandwich ($16.00)***
I'm a big grilled cheese fan and of Cowgirl Creamery, so how could I resist this perfect duo?  The Acme focaccia was nicely grilled and stuffed with a nice heaping of Cowgirl's Fromage​ blanc (can't ever go wrong with Cowgirl!).  I'd definitely suggest eating this asap.  I waited about 10 minutes and the cheese lost all of its stringy cheesy goodness (my bad).

***Mixed Greens ($8.00)***
Admittedly​, I was a bit disappointed that they ran out of fries on my first visit.  Who doesn't love a good side of fries?  Turns out, their side green salad was a good alternative.  At home, I typically only have salads made with greens I've purchased the same day from a farmer's market because I like the freshest of fresh salads and I don't like my greens even a bit wilted.  Well, the greens here were farmer's market-like fresh and came with a tasty mustard-based​ dressing.  

I've always been a fan of Hog Island and now I'm definitely a fan of their new Larkspur location​!!

Pro Tip: 

1)  Give em' a break if they run short on menu items (which they did on both my visits).  They just opened in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis and are working hard during an unprecedented difficult time for all restaurants.

2) Get the Cali Hali Club or the Burger. You can thank me later :)","{""Friends"":730,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/xNc6cQ4olKUk2HOfn5RFYg/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""San Francisco Bay Area, CA"",""Photos"":5447,""Reviews_made"":785,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=LNEXz0drBNtLHwrb1G-VPA"",""Username"":""Lori N.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8HBNMsBwt-v2q6ZVMeTEzw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SHJluu6r-01yuP_rve0yUQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VlMl_F70cfAcYx6nkTKoXQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-YFVuJsTExmI2oclbe7LuQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QElEfMoXmD9WEUwdcDXXow/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6yimeqjyxewVX1vG_pK8Gw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nxa-aoEj6ekK3HWupOqS3g/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/NdSXxQaIqxl6WErD8dflmQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KDRWcyq6_ksHVwsCgaUmjQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oHxuPPgcApg2IU0l0gJHUw/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":59,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":57,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",204,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","Hog Island Larkspur",true

"hog-island-larkspur-larkspur","""03/04/2023""",5,"We went to Hog Island for a quiet Sunday evening celebration of my wife's 70th birthday. Let me begin by saying my wife has been in the customer service industry for 50 years. I have decades in customer service as well. We are always generous when tipping and always kind and patient with wait staff and managers as we appreciate the hard job they have to do.

When we arrived, there was no inside seating so we asked for an available outside table. It was pretty breezy and after several minutes the table next to us under the heater cleared. We asked if we could move over as it had been sitting empty. The waiter seemed for no reason we could discern had an attitude and snapped; ""I will have to check."" Ok, check with who we wondered... but we waited patiently instead of just simply moving over. 

This waiter hems and haws for several minutes before supposedly ""checking.""  He returns after a few more minutes saying another party was going to sit there. I said but we were here first. He said they were a party of four. We said our table was for four so why was that a problem? That was the end of our conversation. He had enough and again snapped speaking down to us saying; ""I will have my manager come over to you to explain why you can't move..."" as he turns and walks away. I now felt like we did something wrong, Wow! 

After a few minutes, no manager... The waiter is standing over other *younger* customers helping them and totally ignoring us. I really did not want to ruin my wife's special day by leaving but it was clear the server was now not going to serve us and the evening was going to be absoultely awful. I said to my wife we need to leave. She reluctantly agreed but we did not have a backup plan. It was a sad, upsetting moment in what was supposed to be a simple, quiet, happy time celebrating together. 

We get up, my wife walks toward the parking lot and then the manager, Jamie, comes up asking me if there was an issue. I explain the situation. He says no one ever approached him and this was the first he was hearing of this incident. We could not believe this waiter actually LIED to us!  Unforgivable.  Jamie approached me saying based on our body language getting up suddenly, he immediately knew something was wrong and caught me on my way out. Great customer service!

My wife is already in the parking lot walking away. Jamie asked more than once if I could bring her back saying; ""Please let me make this right for you."" ""Please give me a chance!"" He was being 100% sincere. After a couple of tries, I do convince my wife to come back. We love Hog Island after all... 

Jamie moves us away from this server's area and sits us on an outside bench promising to seat us in a few minutes. He was very apologetic asking us if we would like a complimentary drink, we thanked him but passed on alcohol. Without asking, after few minutes he brings us a wonderful bottle of Mountain Spring water which he said was his favorite. It was excellent. As we are sitting on the outside bench waiting, I glance over and that same server is now standing there at his station about 15-20 feet away literally glaring at us smirking and appearing to say something to a co-worker. I briefly catch his eye. It felt he was trying to taunt me. It was uncomfortable. My wife says ignore him. We both did the remainder of the evening. A few minutes pass and Jamie comes back and warmly seats us at the bar.

I cannot say enough good things about how Jamie and staff treated us. He personally served us and checked back with us several times during the evening. It was wonderful and turned a negative experience into a totally positive, memorable time out we will not soon forget. We could not be more appreciative. Every staff member bent over backwards to make us feel wanted and special. Jamie and staff brought us some very special treats to make up for our initial experience. The food was fantastic! At day's end, it could not have been a better birthday out! 

In closing:
We have been going out to visit Hog Island for many decades. We've never been treated that way by a server, ever, at Hog Island or at any other establishment. We were only asking to be seated in the warmer spot. Was that really too much for us to ask as patrons? This server copped an attitude for no reason. In our opinion, he has no business being in the service industry. We hope management will take our concerns with this server seriously and make what we feel are needed staffing adjustments. His way of handling us was unexpected, unnecessary and uncalled for. Lying to us says it all! We both thought of saying something to him as we left but to what end? Putting that behind us, on behalf of my wife, a huge thank you to Jamie and staff! We will be back again soon!","{""Friends"":0,""Location"":""San Rafael, CA"",""Photos"":0,""Reviews_made"":23,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=p0BkJRIXq9cS4HLjmHwH4A"",""Username"":""Larry M.""}","null","[{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""Sorry about all that Larry!

"hog-island-larkspur-larkspur","""28/02/2022""",1,"Nothing quite like (subconscious) suburban racism.

Terrible service.  The shop is basically a diner with untrained kids running around.  While Hog Island has long been a tourist attraction, service here lacks the charm and finesse of Inverness, San Francisco, and many other regions of Northern California.  

A disappointing example of mediocre suburban kids running a small town establishment (racist, whether ""subconsciously"" or not).  Of course, this is not representative of Mill Valley.  Walk a few hundred yards up to Farmshop, and breathe a sigh of relief with an elevated establishment that understands grace. 

The entire parking lot ""patio section"" had no White families seated, only families of color.  In 2022, in the Bay Area?  A disappointing joke.  

If a business owner needs to say ""this wasn't discrimination"" in a review, yet there is a plethora of similar disappointing experiences... Well, not quite convincing.  

The lack of sophistication  I encounter amongst young Americans is always surprising in comparison to that of European teenagers, even.  That said, gracious service free of racism--no matter how overt or subtle--doesn't require sophistication of any sort; just a deeper sense of goodness as human beings (and a natural sense of etiquette).

I never post reviews.

The prices are completely astronomical for what you get, and what you get is either full of chilis (so you can't taste anything else), or completely devoid of taste (except maybe for fish bones and....well, more chilis) -- is the kitchen out of salt and pepper??  Really?  I just ordered seafood stew -- whitefish, mussles, clams, shrimp, in a shell stock......supposedly.  I really have no idea since it was so full of chili, it was essentially tres chilis brodo.  The fish was sooooo overdone and dry, couldn't even pick it up.  The shellfish and mollusks were beyond Goodyear rubber.  You all just using yesterdays....orrrrr, the day before, and throwing a half ton of chili in it hoping no one will notice??

It's almost impressive how some of the risotto was undercooked, yet others were almost crunchy -- that takes SKILL.  The oyster mushroom -- STEMS only -- had the equivalent chew *and* taste of 5 day old turkey.  You topped this mess with THE smallest fillet, errr...slice, that I've ever seen.

"hog-island-larkspur-larkspur","""06/03/2023""",5,"I recently visited Hog Island and ordered a dozen mixed oysters and the clam chowder. Hog Island really shines in highlighting the freshness and quality of their seafood, and both dishes were  well presented.

The oysters on the half shell were a great way to try a variety of selected oysters and their distinct flavor profiles. They had a taste that was both briny and sweet, and a texture that was simultaneously creamy and firm.

The clam chowder was rich and creamy, with a hearty base of potatoes, onions, and celery that perfectly complemented the tender clams. The flavors were well-balanced with savory herbs, making it a warm and comforting dish that was perfect for a chilly day.

Every spoonful of the clam chowder was filled with chunks of fresh, succulent clams that added a satisfying texture to the dish. The chowder was also served with freshly-baked bread, which was the perfect to soak up all the delicious flavors.

Overall, I highly recommend Hog Island for their exceptional seafood and fantastic service.

"hog-island-larkspur-larkspur","""20/05/2022""",3,"Came by here after a long day hiking in Muir Woods. It was around 5pm Saturday evening and the wait was around 45 minutes. The restaurant is located in a small shopping center with plenty of other stores so we walked around before getting seated.

We ordered oysters and salmon tartare as appetizers. The oysters tasted really fresh and there was a good variety to try from. The salmon tartare was not bad, but honestly nothing special if you'd had salmon poke bowls before.

I ordered the oyster poboy and split a clam chowder with my friend. The oysters in the sandwich were pretty good, but the sandwich was a bit small. I also kinda prefer the more traditional French bread over the buns that were used, but the bread wasn't bad. 

The chowder had lots of clams, but felt pretty thin for a chowder. It felt more like a clam suit than a proper thick clam chowder.

My friend got the risotto with some fish (we forgot what kind) and he thought it was not bad. He mentioned the fish felt under seasoned.

Service was not bad overall. One thing that stuck out was we ordered a side of bread as an appetizer, but we had to ask for the bread after our entrees already came out. The bread was also cold when we got it. It was good bread but probably should have been heated up a bit.

Pretty decent seafood, but I'll probably be trying other places before returning here.","{""Friends"":233,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/9Zn8S1_2F_ePLPTDKdnJ8g/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""San Leandro, CA"",""Photos"":121,""Reviews_made"":81,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=4KBt1Nd3JZ7c5cW7va41dQ"",""Username"":""Ryan L.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Nm2Ui9fIbqcE4GmXHe_96Q/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VsfYN5mbuOGonDKlsZpEBg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5d2lW-CKvni3IvvA1FjViw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OIHw0Ga0XuOvAUHC54ozKg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/E2bvmX55KuHgXZPF2cLraw/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":2,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",109,"","0 check-in","Hog Island Larkspur",true

If you are yearning for lamb for lunch come to Ziziki's. They have several options of lamb. Lamb soulvaki, lamb of leg (sliced), and rack of lamb. 

Since the company was paying, I really wanted have rack of lamb but i didn't want to seem like a fat bastard. So i settled for the lamb soulvaki. 

I wasn't disappointed nonetheless. The square kabobs of lamb were placed on a skewer and covered with this delicious greek yogurt.

The lamb soulvaki was so delicious. It was cooked to the right temperature a medium rare. It had a nice char. It was a bit on the chewy side.  It was dressed with vegtetables.

The potatoes were surprising good as well. They were nice and crispy and were well seasoned. It also came with a feta onion salad.

Lunch here is a bit pricey. It's 12-20 a person for lunch. Luckily it was my birthday. Oh and they have a different menu for lunch.

It was a lil different compares to other Mediterranean restaurants that I have been to. The orders were smaller and cheaper if you choose the Tapas, (i think that's wat it's called)they'll bring your dishes out in small plates and you can either eat them all by yourself or share with friends. The other option you have is family style. It's about $42. You get 1 big plate with samples of  most stuff on the menu (not all). Me and my sister with no doubt would be able to finish that plate. But I ended up going with the Tapas option cuz i like to have the freedom of choosing wat i want and sample them that way instead of being overwhelm by all the food. 
We ordered the chicken kabob, beef kabob, grilled shrimp, cabbage roll, rice, and of course hummus.
Ya'll probably heard enough about the hummus. But here it goes again. Get it! it's awesome! you wont regret it!
Chicken kabob and the grilled shrimp were so delicious. We ended up ordering another chicken kabob.
The beef kabob and cabbage roll were meh. Definitely not my favorite.
The rice was nothing special. 
The atmosphere was nice until it got so packed.

The Hog Island Oyster Earthquakes have a deeper shell filled with more liquor to enjoy with or without the mignonette.

The clam chowder is great because there are plenty of clams and the bacon bits do not overpower the clam flavor.

Steamed mussels are another solid pick. If you enjoy a white wine broth with plump and succulent meat, then it will hit the spot.

My fav though is their shrimp tomato cream pasta. Super rich and indulgent.

They also sell a homemade mignonette and threw in some lemons.

They're permitted to sell bottles of sparkling and still wines, as well as bottled cocktails to go. The Clarified Brandy Colada would be worth driving to Larkspur for. The secret is likely the clear, clarified milk liquid and other top notch ingredients (see recipe).
We also had the Caesar Salad, with uncut, larger baby romaine leaves, a fragrant mustardy dressing, large crunchy croutons, and la pièce de résistance, 6 boquerones-- mild, white, tiny, European pickled anchovies (in no way fishy like traditional anchovies).

Also ordered the fish sandwich and burger. The fish sandwich was also a little flavorless and the burger was average. 

Oysters were flavorful and delicious though! Ordered a couple uncooked oysters as well to bring home and they were super nice.

Bad news - horrible food. (Sorry to the homeless person I gift remains to)
1. Fish sandwich - tiny piece of unseasoned fish between a seriously stale bun.
2. Fish tacos on cold and hard tortillas.
3. Shrimp, andouille sausage and  polenta way over seasoned.
4. The calamari? Remember the industrial rubberbands from arts and crafts in high school? Yep.
5. Sent the oysters back upon arrival. They confused our requested small with extra large.
6. Stale table bread.

Typically people quite like our food, and so I am very sorry that this was not your experience. It is disappointing to hear that truly everything was not to your liking, I wish you could have had a better experience. I obviously can not, and would not, want to dispute your feelings about the food. However, I would like to just give some info if it helps at all. I can tell you that all of our bread is made fresh daily by Acme bread company (usually highly regarded) so I could not see the bread being stale. It may have a different consistency then hoped for, especially if you dined later in the evening, but it would fresh everyday. Likewise, we do not use frozen blocked calamari. We use only fresh fish and we also use the entire length of the calamari for our dish, and not just the body of the fish (which is typically the bands you are referring to). So you should have seen tentacles as well, but again apologies if this was not the case. As to the other issues, we do change the menu daily, and order fish daily based on availability, so we cannot ever guarantee availability of any product. I am sorry if this was miscommunicated to you. Likewise, a mistake on your order there is no defense for, so I can only offer my apologies. In any case, I will pass this all along to our chef and hopefully you would not have this experience again.

"hog-island-larkspur-larkspur","""22/10/2022""",1,"Went here for lunch with my husband, we ordered a dozen raw oysters, bread w/butter, clam chowder and trout salad. Both of us had stomach pains and diarrhea the whole afternoon due to food poisoning.

Been to SF location, Napa, Tomale bay location, and even ordered from this Larkspur location couple times. First time having issue with it. We both thought the problems came from those raw oysters, we had mix oysters. I did not see other table around us had order it, all of those people had salad and sandwiches for lunch. Hopefully no other ones had encountered the same issue we had today, totally ruined our day! Still had stomach pains while writing this review.

Called around 7:45pm, no one answered the phone, so I left a voicemail, hopefully someone will reach us back at some point. 

Or maybe Someone in charge see our review and check your raw oysters quality and cleanliness before serving to other consumers at this time. 

Forgot to take our receipt for posting, will avoiding this place for future no matter how much we liked it before!

"hog-island-larkspur-larkspur","""21/02/2021""",4,"I came here as a party of 4 for outdoor patio dining on a Saturday morning and would highly recommend arriving 5-10 minutes prior to the restaurant opening as they do not take reservations. It's a first come first serve basis. Since they opened at 11:30 AM, we got there at 11:20 AM and there was a small line with about 3-4 parties ahead of us. We were promptly seated by 11:35 AM. 

We ordered the clam chowder, fish sandwich, Calabrian chili grilled oysters, and a voyage punch. 

*Clam chowder (3/5): When we got our clam chowder, I was a little surprised because it did not look like the traditional clam chowder I was expecting. There was an abundance of Manila clams in the soup and the soup itself was not thick at all; it was very watery. The soup tasted like milk without much clam flavoring. There were celery bits, carrots, bacon, and skin-on boiled potatoes. The clams themselves were cooked well, not over cooked and not too chewy. However, given this was $17 a bowl, it just wasn't to our taste. There wasn't any crackers or bread or pepper to accompany this dish. Very anti-climatic!

*Fish sandwich (4/5): The fish sandwich was delicious. The fish was perfectly fried with a crispy texture on the outside and the fish was soft and flaky in the inside. However, the sandwich bread itself was very hard and chewy, a little burnt on the bottom. The fish sandwich had avocado and lettuce which were great additions. It needed more aioli or sauce so it would be less dry. The fries were as expected, crispy with a sprinkle of salt on top. 

*Calabrian chili grilled oysters (4/5): These oysters were tasty. The chili sauce was not spicy at all and it did have a slight tartness to it similar to Tabasco sauce. Oysters were fresh and very delectable. 

*Voyage punch (4/5): The cocktail was well-executed and a great mixed drink. This one in particular had rum, pineapple juice, luxardo maraschino cherry juice, absinthe. This combination greatly resembled the taste of a tropical mai tai. Not too sweet and it was quite refreshing. I wish they would have put an actual luxardo maraschino cherry in it though!

All in all, great outdoor patio experience. Waiters and waitresses wore masks and maintained their social distancing with customers.

"cafe-izmir-dallas","""11/03/2014""",2,"I'd been to Cafe Izmir exactly once before. The food was meh and pricey. The interior and service fine but something there feels a little off. So I hadn't been back for several years. But then I had a groupon to use up. Even with $20 off (from the groupon), my friend and I felt totally ripped off.

Basically, nothing seemed fresh, except the pita. 
We went at the beginning of their night - 6pm (they open at 5:30), so everything should have been fresh, fresh fresh. A spread of mostly veggies was ordered.

The spicy hummus is very good but a tiny portion for price ($6) and pita to go with it is extra ($2) and not enough to get through the hummus with.

Grilled veggies (6.25) were a nice variety but came out room temperature, as did the grilled tomatoes ($3) and extremely mediocre, overcooked and rubbery ""Pomegranate Shrimp Spicy"" (9.95 for 6) which seemed to be missing the spicy part. All of these seemed pre-cooked. 

A baked sweet potato was the only thing served hot (other than that aforementioned great pita bread!) and was tasty but not so much on the mediterranean tip. More American holiday.

We also got the olives ($5 for about 15). 

To top it off, we were seated in a corner that seemed cozy but it felt like the two tables next to us were sitting with us. It was also next to the bathroom which had clearly just been cleaned with chemical cleaner. Not the best smell mingling with room-temperature, pre-cooked food.

The table was tiny and plates were not cleared efficiently. Until near the end when a fella came by and kept trying to take a few we weren't done with, yet. (ha!)

Man! I hate to have had such a bad experience there because half the menu is vegan and there are so many veg options.

What can you do?
Maybe the glowing reviews are big meat eaters and that's where they rock it?

Aside from the oysters - which all come from HIOC, were delicious and fresh, the food was extremely ""meh"". One had the fish sandwich - looked good, but bland. My mom and I shared the famous grilled cheese and fish tacos - the cheese sandwich was nothing like the one I've had at the Ferry building, and arrived cold, cheese not fully melted (what there was of cheese), the tacos were basically a corn tortilla with a small piece of fried cod and about two cups of shredded cabbage - a small wedge of lime was the only thing offered to amp it up. The mussels were decent, the fries were hot. The service was okay - our main server was very sweet and patient, food runner had a terrible attitude. When we pointed out a hair in our food, they shrugged - no offer to take the item off the bill. In short, avoid this location - totally a bummer to the HIOC reputation.

Food:
Clam chowder with bread add on: was very good & has actual clams with shell in it. The soup was on the watery end but somehow very flavorful. There was bits of carrot, celery, and bacon were a nice added texture and flavor. The bread that we ordered as an add on was a nice artisan piece with nice crust and had good density.

Oysters: we ordered the Kumamoto & Atlantic(the sweet small oysters). There were lemon wedges and sauce on the side. The kumamotos were not as buttery tasting as some other ones I have had but still had a sweet light sea taste. The Atlantic had a sweetness profile in the beginning and more sea & salty taste in the end.

Drinks:
Watermelon wave: tasted like a nice watermelon jolly rancher. Definitely on the sweet side. Not a lot of alcohol in it.

Bloody Mary:
It was okay.

But the wine selection is better than most of the other Greek places I know, and the place is sleek and sexy.  I had the souvlaki platter with the calamari for an appetizer and the baklava ice cream cake dessert.  The dessert was really good--although I've never met a plain (that word should never be used as an adjective to describe such divine treat) baklava I didn't like.  Due to the ample nutmeg in the pastry, and the creamy ice cream, the dessert was oddly reminiscent of egg nog.  Of which I am a fan!  The calamari was nicely fried and I liked the two sauces, but the serving size was small...and calamari isn't exactly a costly seafood so....
My souvlaki was underwhelming.  I would have liked to see more vegetables.  The pita/naan bread was soft and warm and thick, but other than the generous chicken and red onions atop, it was empty.  It begged for some tomatoes, cucumbers, and other Greek salad fare---and please--throw some feta on that thing!","{""Friends"":44,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/n0AWIRsFWcRkUle4gshw7A/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Dallas, TX"",""Photos"":133,""Reviews_made"":379,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=6H40K6iKmP9LORYXqeO3qA"",""Username"":""Carolyn H.""}","null","[{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""Carolyn we are happy that you've dined with us on multiple occasions.

The clam chowder is totally worth the price, and just $2 for a fresh rustic loaf of bread to sop up the creamy broth. It's PACKED with fresh clams (shell-on), which makes it so unique from other chowders. You truly taste ""the ocean"". The veggies are perfectly cooked until they're just tender so you can truly enjoy the flavor of leek, carrot, celery, potato, and BACON. I'm a celery hater, and I still ate very bite. The best part is no matter how much you keep digging, you'll still find more clams! And no surprising bits of sand.

I also got the oyster po' boy to bring back for my boyfriend, which came with delicious, crispy fries (made from starchy, firm potatoes). Most of the fries didn't make it home :). The oysters were fresh but the clam chowder is where it's at!

Definitely recommend if you're in the Marin area. Service is friendly, organized, and COVID safe. There are some outdoor benches to enjoy the sun and watch the cutest dogs.

"hog-island-larkspur-larkspur","""29/09/2021""",4,"I frequented hog island at the ferry building often so pretty familiar with their dishes and flavors.  I opted for a dozen of their pacific sweet water oysters which was the right choice.  Slightly bigger than kumo but still ranged as small has always been my preferred size when it comes to raw oysters.  Fresh, sweet, and taste of the ocean, recommended.

The grilled Monterey squids was slightly over cooked so it was rubbery in texture and flavor was bland.

The clam chowder came in a brothy cream base with fresh clams, bacon, and potatoes so don't expect a thick New England style clam chowder.  I liked how it was made but the broth was lacking the clam broth flavor so I couldn't finish it.

The cod risotto was flavorful with a very powerful cheesy taste.  Good portion size fish and it was cooked well, would recommend it.

Had an Arnold Palmer which was good and flavorful. Not sure what type of lemonade they used, but it was good.

We ordered the Hog Island Sweetwaters to start and they were delicious. Sweet with just a hit of brinyness at the end. My guest has the clam chowder which was meal size rather than starter size. It looked great. He also ordered fish tacos expecting the chowder to be a smaller serving. It looked good but very messy as it was so loaded with the fish and slaw.

I had the blackened salmon over couscous and corn purée. The couscous and purée were very good. The salmon was very fresh and well cooked but needed a good sprinkle of salt.

Service was very good. Prices were not inexpensive, but fine for the quality of ingredients.

Would be 4-1/2 stars if the salmon was better seasoned.

"hog-island-larkspur-larkspur","""19/10/2020""",3,"Update: I've bumped this place up a star as I appreciate the customer service they provided in their follow up. Although it didn't change my experience, it illustrated the importance of customer feedback and their willingness to make improvements. 

Original review: I really wanted to like this place. After all, I had a good experience at their location in West Marin and loved their oysters. This place fell short and left me feeling disappointed. 

I appreciate the cute outdoor dining space they created - it gave me a chance to bring my doggo along for the meal. I also liked the friendliness of their servers and understood that they tried to keep contact minimum so they didn't frequent tables often. That's pretty much where the stars went...

Food was mediocre. While it was great that I could get a combo of fried shrimp (large ones too) and fried oysters in my po'boy, the sandwich was not cutting it for me. I've never had it burger style and didn't feel that it was a good choice when they're usually done hoagie style. The coleslaw was lacking in flavor (nothing but tanginess) and upon arrival, had soaked through the bread, making it hard to hold without it falling apart underneath my hands. I also can't bear the taste of overly soggy bread (it's a texture thing) and found myself picking out the seafood for half of it. At least I had some relatively tasty fries to make up for the wasted carbs. I also ordered a crab roll (not pictured) and it was literally just crab in a roll. No flavor whatsoever. It didn't look nor taste like it was tossed in any seasoning, but at least I got my money's worth because the roll was adequately packed. Maybe I'll just stick to fresh oysters from now on since they don't require much work on their kitchen's end...","{""Friends"":69,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/KxsiTCMnC_2hdk_vONXsMQ/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Walnut Creek, CA"",""Photos"":720,""Reviews_made"":215,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ki-CDc190Pb7yDZYoakXOQ"",""Username"":""Jenny W.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/EDNrXGWfJTqou_S4xW4KKw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gEjdDCRfiqAlbtP9vJiZyg/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":3,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":2,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",202,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","Hog Island Larkspur",true

"hog-island-larkspur-larkspur","""10/10/2020""",5,"My wife and I decided to have a nice lunch here on a beautiful afternoon. First I would like to point out that Hog Island in Larkspur is very Covid friendly and has lots of comfortable outdoor seating that doesn't feel forced like at some establishments nowadays.

We were greeted with friendly service from our server John that was very helpful and accommodating. We started with some fresh Hog Island Sweetwater oysters and some fresh Kumamoto oysters. They were both delicious and could tell they were very fresh, probably plucked from the ocean that morning. If I had to choose, I'd probably enjoyed the Kumamoto oysters more. We also ordered the halibut ceviche which was SO DELICIOUS! It was light and wasn't overwhelming with sour/citrus like other places. It was just deliciously refreshing with nice big chunks of halibut and avocado, highly recommend. 

My wife ordered the chowder and she was blown away. We knew the moment it was served it was a serious bowl of chowder. The clams were still in the shell (sure more work but you know it's fresh!), it had chunks of bacon, and smelled superb. It was so creamy and delicious and every aspect of the chowder tied together perfectly. 

I ordered the crispy halibut sandwich with added avocado ($3 upcharge but I highly recommend). It was SO GOOD! The breading was light but loaded with flavor. Because the breading was light the fish was not greasy at all which I really appreciated. The aioli went really well with every aspect of the sandwich as well.

Overall we had a great experience and will most definitely be back.

I left my GF and our dog in the car and went to see if they had any seating in the shade.  I was told yes, but I couldn't be seated until the entire party was there.  I said I understood, that my GF was in the car I need to go get her, and the host repeated herself and told me I couldn't be seated until the entire party was there.  I repeated myself ""I just need to go get her"".  No smile, no welcome, maybe the heat was too much for her.  She wasn't pleasant.  Our server was clueless but very friendly and had an upbeat personality.  I overheard another server tell her table they were short one person.  I suppose it can be stressing to some when they have to pick up the slack. 

We had 4 different oysters and they were fresh and delicious.   We asked our server if we could get the patty melt medium rare and she told us no, it's a thin patty and is cooked medium.  We ordered it anyway and it came out medium rare.  It was good.  They fries were great.

The way we handle what oysters are available for in-house dining vs take-away, has to do with allocation of what we have available on-site on any given day. Sometimes we have enough Sweetwaters to offer them both in-house and for take-out, sometimes we don't have enough Sweetwaters to have them in either form. It really just depends on what our farm has available each day for us to order. This is likely why we had different styles for take-out vs dine-in on the day you ordered.\n\nIn any case, this sounds like more of a misunderstanding then something we could not rectify. Had we realized that you wanted specifically Sweetwaters (and assuming we have Sweetwaters in-house to begin with) we likely could have given you some in this specific instance, even if we typically do not offer them for take-away. So apologies for the miscommunication. I would only suggest in the future inquiring about the possibility of getting Sweetwaters by calling in ahead of time.\n\nI hope that you would reconsider this review, and more importantly, getting take-out oysters in the future, now that we are able to provide you with better options in future visits.

"hog-island-larkspur-larkspur","""07/05/2020""",4,"I've been eyeing this place for quite some time now but didn't have the courage to check it out until, ironically, the whole world is somewhat shut down by the current pandemic. Despite the apocalyptic mode that the city seems to be under, Hog Island is still up for appeasing the appetites of the foodies with its take-outs and deliveries. And what's best to eat when your next meal might be your last? A feast, of course. I, for one, didn't hold back from ordering a selection of some of Hog Island's favorites--clam chowder, shrimp pappardelle, steamed mussels, and the pescatore dinner for two. I was giddy with excitement when I got home but was somewhat let down by finding that, for some reason, the pescatore stew was put into a paper box instead of a more suitable to-go container for a soup-containing dish. Some of the broth actually spilled out of the container but was fortunately still contained within the plastic bag and didn't spill into my trunk space. For a combo that costed $68, I would expect it to be stored in a much more sensible manner than that, so the discovery was a bit of an unpleasant surprise for me. In any case, I do love their shrimp pappardelle in that they used huge shrimps for the dish and the noodles were al dente. The seasoning was also perfect for me. The salt and zest in the flavor of the sauce didn't overpower the taste of the main ingredients. For the steamed mussels, I wasn't as wowed by the dish since the mussels were a bit tiny and the broth/sauce was a too salty for me. Their clam chowder, on the other hand, is the real deal. Hell, I like it even more than the pescatore stew since this is the first time I have clam chowder with actual littleneck clams rather than souls or clams or canned clam pieces. This will definitely be on my list of what I'd highly recommend from this place. As far as the pescatore goes, I felt like it was a pretty good cioppino-like stew. That's just it though. Although it was good, it wasn't the best I've ever had. The tomato broth was fragrant and lovely and the taste wasn't overly sour or salty. The mussels in this stew were also ginormous compared to the ones in the steamed mussels. Would I order it again for take-out? Maybe I'll be more inclined to do so when they put it into a container that's leak-proofed.","{""Friends"":171,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/dc5XaaCv7NymfgGmuL_QIQ/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Philadelphia, PA"",""Photos"":713,""Reviews_made"":370,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=mRbyh9_3gw9IOyCu9iti2g"",""Username"":""Joy H.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MHsE2XStfUQA3Ce33Mvx-w/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/u-XA5iMwRtej9IHEqRcxgA/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":2,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":2,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",301,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","Hog Island Larkspur",true

I was all ready to give this restaurant a 5-star review but ended up leaving very disappointed when I was informed by the female manager that my Living Social coupon - which was due to expire in a couple of weeks, could not be honored for lunch (even though it doesn't say that anywhere in the offer's fine print.)\n\nWhen I first presented the coupon to our young waiter, he said, \""Oh, I'm afraid we can't take this.  It's only good for dine-in\"".  I looked at him kinda puzzled and said, \""That's just what we got done doing - dining in\"".  Then after getting clarification from the manger, he returned and said that the offer was only good for DINNER and I was not the first customer that had to be made aware of their policy.  Again, no where on the coupon does it say, \""Valid for dinner only\"".  Had I known that, I would not have bothered to purchase this offer as this location is only convenient for lunch during the work week.\n\nTalk about bogus!  The manager told me I had two weeks to use it before it expired on Aug. 13, and that I could either gift it to someone or ask Living Social for a refund.  She was absolutely no help at all.  Not only that, but she told me that it was Living Social's fault for not stipulating that the offer is only good for DINNER and that they've been trying to get them to make the correction.  That's funny because I just received another Living Social offer TODAY in my in-box from Cafe Izmir and again, no where on that new offer does it say it can only be used at dinner.  She also said that if I go to Groupon and Yelp and viewed the same offer, that is says valid for dinner only.  Well, I beg to differ.  Just so happens that when I checked in upon arrival, a $20 for $10 offer popped up on my screen.  Too bad I didn't bother to look at it while I was still in the restaurant because AGAIN, no where on the Yelp offer does it say \""not valid at lunch\"" or \""dinner only offer\"".  If you don't believe me, go onto Yelp and check out the offer for yourself.\n\nCustomers are going to be upset (and rightfully so), when they purchase this offer thinking they can use it anytime only to be turned down when they show up for lunch.  I guess since the dinner menu prices are always higher than lunch, it's more profitable for them to want to restrict the coupon to dinner only and that's fine - but they need to state that in the fine print instead of putting the blame on Living Social for not getting the advertisement correct.  One thing's for certain, they either need to honor the coupon deals that they're putting out on Living Social or just stop advertising all together."",""Date"":""03/08/2015"",""Images"":[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/sz4hu_XXBNBOiTYTJJSVHw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6uAbkBiT5xiPVAt3ncZrwQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Gyie1IpXFl-gQTDf-qXYjQ/348s.jpg""],""User_Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/dRqiA8OZanE3pGI7E1floA/60s.jpg"",""Username"":""Diane D.""}]",207,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","Cafe Izmir",true

This is my absolute favorite place for clam chowder ($17). Pricier than most places but you pay for the quality and freshness. What clam chowder do you know jam packs the bowl with fresh clams?! It also comes with veggies, bacon, and potatoes. I thought I knew good clam chowder when I went to SLO and Boudin.. nah, Hog Island is top-notch. And their steamed mussels are to die for - so full of flavor. I love mussels in green curry!! I found the sauce to be a little salty with the bread though. 

You know it's quality when they use Heath Ceramics... haha jk. But I mean it when I say their food is quality! We just found it so funny that we noticed this because I had just gifted my bougie sister their plate sets for her wedding. Does this make us plate connoisseurs now? LOL

"hog-island-larkspur-larkspur","""10/08/2020""",5,"Can people live on oysters alone?  If I lived closer to Hog Island, I might try to do so.  In any case, I'll just have to eat here when I visit Marin County.  On this visit, I arrived at 5:00 PM on a Friday afternoon, the weather perfect for dining outdoors (which was very convenient, since indoor dining was not allowed yet in the county).  There were several seating options available, so my wife & I chose a nice large picnic table in the sun. (By 6:00 PM, there was a decent wait for tables.)

We ordered a half-dozen fresh oyster mix, one order of 4 Chimichurri grilled oysters, and one order of house-made pickled vegetables to share.  I ordered the Shrimp Po'Boy and she ordered the Halibut Sandwich.  We also ordered one cocktail each (Headlands Old Fashioned for her, the Watermelon Wake for me).

The oysters and pickled veggies arrived very quickly, and the entrees soon followed.  All the oysters were delicious; the fresh ones were very refreshing, and the grilled ones had enough garlic and chili to be interesting.  While I enjoyed the grilled oysters, one order was enough to provide contrast to the meal, while I could have slurped down another dozen or two of the fresh ones.

My Po'Boy was served on a focaccia bun (not on a traditional french style roll) with a side of fries.  The battered shrimp filled the bun, topped with a generous helping of coleslaw.  The combination of flavors was perfect, though the slaw made eating this sandwich very messy.  In hindsight, I should have asked for more napkins!  In the same way, my wife enjoyed the halibut sandwich, which was much easier to eat.  

The only dish we didn't enjoy was the pickled vegetables.  They had an interesting orange color to them (which we think was turmeric) and didn't taste like standard pickled veggies.  Perhaps these are very popular, but they weren't our cup of tea.  Hard pass for the next time.

"hog-island-larkspur-larkspur","""25/06/2021""",2,"What a strange place! Everything about our experience felt abnormal. 

We were told our wait would be 40 minutes, but it was over 90 minutes. At 3pm. On a Monday. I got the sense they did not like that we brought two young children with us, as people without children were seated right away. 

We ordered a kids' hamburger, which was just meat on a bun. We asked for lettuce and tomato *for the burger* and were told they did not have any tomatoes in the entire restaurant. The waitress also brought back a bowl of mixed greens, including lettuce, kale, etc. We asked if they could get our kiddo some pickles, and they charged us $7 for PICKLED CAULIFLOWER and other pickled veggies. What?! 

We got oysters. They were delicious. 

My husband ordered a ""rustic seafood stew,"" which came with ... TOMATOES! So, they either lied about not having tomatoes, or the tomatoes in my husband's stew came from a can. Also, they did not give him any bread to dip, which is weird. I tasted the stew. The broth was nothing to write home about. The clams and mussels were not cleaned well. 

I ordered the halibut burger, with NO ONION. They brought me a halibut burger with lots of onion. I told them I could not eat it, and they took it all the way back to the kitchen just to pull off the red onion and hand it back to me - smelling strongly of red onion. I asked for a new burger, and the waitress told me it came with onion powder (a seasoning), which is whatever. The halibut was overcooked, dry, and suuuuuper salty! Bleh. 

The service was super slow, and our waitress took almost the entire meal to finally tell us about ""the tomato situation,"" which was ridiculous. She also regularly walked around to other nearby tables (w/o children), frequently skipping past ours and not checking in. 

My husband and I also had a couple drinks. He had beer, and I drank wine. Our drinks were comped because things went so wrong in so many ways. 

Not worth the $200 price tag.

I've had the Bourbon butter grilled oysters my last visit and this sauce is too sweet for my taste. This time I tried the Paris version that uses anchovy and Parmesan cheese and it is delicious and compliments the oysters well.  As can see in photos, I received 2 small and 2 medium oysters cooked perfectly.  

I also had fish tacos that were a bit disappointing.  The amount of fish is very small.  In addition the amount of shredded cabbage was huge.  This made it sloppy to eat and tasted more like a cabbage than fish taco.    Come on guys it's cod fish not lobster.  For the price it needs more fish.

The service was okay and the Waiter polite, but he wasn't very knowledgeable of the vegan offerings as we had to wait for him to go and ask questions as well as have our Falafels taken back because they had a yogurt sauce on them. We had to flag him down a couple of times, which didn't make much sense considering we were the only people in the restaurant. The biggest thing that got us was the strange fact that their hummus, a staple in any vegan diet, had dairy in it. We asked if they could make a small batch without it for us since we were the only ones there and he said it was pre-made so it couldn't be done. It just blew our mind that we couldn't have the biggest thing at any Mediterranean restaurant because they decided that dairy would make it better. We felt like our meal wasn't as good as it could have been without that staple dish and therefore left unsatisfied and kind of cheated.","{""Friends"":400,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/TPMrhXVPPT-FLYhJdxtSpQ/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Denton, TX"",""Photos"":1874,""Reviews_made"":22,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=2xacogfV_skPM3tR7wk8-Q"",""Username"":""Courtney G.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hrOhzFV9paH_C-jecCyuUA/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":2,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",405,"","0 check-in","Cafe Izmir",true

I love Hog Island and this is one of those few times where I would  break the rule of never leaving the city for a meal (let alone crossing a bridge or two! to get there). While the SF Ferry Building location is much closer, it just doesn't nearly have as much seating as this one nor a parking lot for that matter. It was a beautiful Friday afternoon so it made it even better because the sun was out and the view was amazing.

They don't take reservations but that's fine because there was no wait for a table! We opted for outdoor seating on the benches which had the best view of the bay. For starters the sweet waters were excellent and delicious as I remembered. You can never have enough of these so we opted for another dozen after slurping down the first. The hog wash is such a great tasting sauce to go with fresh oysters and salads. Next we had the calamari and I had a nicoise salad as my main. 

Service wise it was good. We got our food and drinks quickly even though there was a number of people dining in the afternoon. I found the staff here very friendly and would return again very soon (breaking my rule of never crossing a bridge).

I called up Ziziki's and asked to make a reservation. The polite host informed me that we could sit at the bar or we could be seated outside. As it was a pleasant evening, we choose outside seating. Upon arrival, we were seated in a very charming, albeit hidden, area outside behind one of the concrete pillars. The place was packed but our waiter met us soon after we arrived, paying particular attention to the fact that we were hidden. We choose the three dip appetizer and the Ziziki salad to start with. The 3 dips were absolutely amazing! The artichoke humus dip was very fresh bursting with flavor as was the spicy hipiti dip and the the spinach feta was a wonderful combination of savory and sweet all served with the freshest pita bread I have ever had. I think it had come out of the oven seconds before being placed on our table. Next we had an amazing fresh, Ziziki salad served with delicious vegetables and an amazing Zizki sauce. We devoured every last bit of that! Before we even had a chance to think about dessert, our waiter presented us with generous piece of baklava ice cream cake which was mind splitting delicious.

"cafe-izmir-dallas","""12/04/2010""",3,"So a bunch of us went to Cafe Izmir to celebrate my friend's 30th birthday. We were seated in the covered patio along with another big group that was there as a bachelorette party. It was quite cramped and very hard to get around with that many people. Even for the waiter because he accidentally spilled wine all over one of the ladies with the bachelorette party. Ooops!

About half of the party ordered off the tapas menu and the other half ordered family style. Family style was momma's choice and included hummus, pita bread, chicken salad, tabouli, saffron rice, meat dish and a veggie dish. The meat dish tonight had lamb rolls, chicken kabobs and beef kabobs. My favorites of the night was the hummus, pita bread and lamb roll.  The lamb roll contained slow roasted shredded leg of lamb with pico de gallo wrapped in a hot tortilla. I totally agree with everyone that the hummus and pita bread is the best in Dallas. I am still craving it now. I could have made my whole meal out of the hummus and pita bread. 

The waitstaff was as accommodating as could be with such a large group. Some of us did not get our meals but they did what they could to make us happy. They gave us an extra meat dish and a round of shots on the house. 

Although small and quaint, I loved the atmosphere of Cafe Izmir with the string of lights, live guitarist and uneven floor boards. What I didn't love was the bathrooms were small and cramped. There was not much wiggle room in the hallway for you to wait if both bathrooms were occupied. 

Even with all the chaos I'd come back again (but with a much smaller group).","{""Friends"":508,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/jOFQVxtugSQAqxUAjlNbnw/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Dallas, TX"",""Photos"":1983,""Reviews_made"":275,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=9t-K8axdDdf-BP8eG9o_ag"",""Username"":""Kellie K.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6jnnnOjQcopkv_do-1sR6Q/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kwXG0tlk7SOddiqDXDxPXA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CjAREFXlo0QGLOOrwpvERg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GtMAWeSQ2yOneSP3e_3tIQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4CZQwhlj5Y-vULklCgPJvw/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",201,"","0 check-in","Cafe Izmir",true

Oysters: For those debating what to get, you can never go wrong with the Sweetwaters (perfect balance between briny and creamy). Also had the Kumamoto's and Carolina Divine Pines, which were both fantastic.

Grilled oysters: They come in 4, but they are happy for you to get 2 orders of different flavors. We got the chipotle bourbon and green garlic grilled oysters, both were solid, but we slightly preferred the smoky and sweetness of the chipotle bourbon. My one criticism for grilled oysters is that you do lose any flavor of the oyster itself and are essentially tasting whatever spices/sauces that it's cooked in.

Chicory Caesar Salad with Shrimp: Solid salad, but on the pricey side for what it is.
Fried Fish sandwich: The cod was perfectly cooked and the batter was not too heavy. The avocado added some nice creaminess and the brioche bun was fantastic.

half a dozen oysters (5/5) - can mix and match! these were so fresh and sweet. I was craving more

Customer service 4/5
Food 5/5

We got:
-Dukes of topsail, hog island sweetwater, and little creek oysters: for us, the dukes of topsail had minimal brine and salinity but the texture was more on the meatier side. Little creek had some brine and was creamy. Hog island sweetwater was lightly meaty, a little heavy on the brine, but the brine hits you initially and then fades out. I really liked how the oysters weren't massive and the temperature of the oysters were cold. 
-Grilled Monterey calamari: this is by far my most favorite place to get their calamari. I love squid but usually don't order it often because either a lot of places might fry them up in thick batter, the texture is just too slimy, or you have to drench it in sauce to make it taste good. The two times we've been here, the calamari hasn't been slimy at all, the textures enjoyable, doesn't have a harsh fishy taste and the sauce is great with it or it can be slurped by itself!
-Local halibut ceviche: it didn't have an intense lime flavor like other ceviches but it was still delicious! The halibut meat was plump but light and melts in your mouth. It doesn't feel heavy either so it was a nice light appetizer.
- Grilled Calabrian oysters: the Calabrian oysters were good. I'm not too much of a fan of grilled oysters in general, but it was still good. The sizes weren't intimidating either. 
-Albacore tuna crudo: another great light appetizer. The grapefruit was an interesting taste with the albacore tuna, but definitely liked them separate.

We ordered all 4 varieties of Pacific oysters on offering that day....they were all excellent. We eat raw oysters at many different seafood restaurants and sometimes it's honestly a hit or miss in terms of wowing us, but at Hog Island we've never had a bland or boring oyster. They know their stuff. We also took a bag of unshucked oysters home, and the server was kind enough to bring us a sample of the take-home oyster to try to help us decide if we wanted to buy a bunch to go, since we kept grilling the poor guy on what all the flavor profiles of the oysters were. 

Clam chowder and steamer clams were as good as always. They were flexible and let my husband ask for the Saffron Mussels dish to be made with clams instead.

"hog-island-larkspur-larkspur","""07/07/2021""",5,"Today everybody has a hankering to go to Hog Island Oyster Company. I prefer the experience on Tomales Bay but because this one is so much closer to my house sometimes you just got to have it and go. Show my wife my daughter and her boyfriend and I all packed into the car and headed over to Hog Island Oyster Company in Larkspur. It was a perfect day to set out and become solid food he's for the afternoon.

When we got there there was always a nice crowd of people that had decided to do the same thing we did but it's never so packed that you can't get in and get a table right away. Even with covid sort of checking out of our area hopefully, we were able to find a table inside or outside but we opted for outside cuz it was a perfect day. Warm breeze sunny skies and our table had a few of the fairies that come in and out so we got a little entertainment with the Bay next to us.

We got to our table and immediately people came over and set up the table and got water bottles and glasses set out so we'd be comfortable while we waited. We collected our menus from a check-in counter outside which makes it very simple because you get your menu and take it with you and their paper menus that you can take home and I recommend that in case you want to order for takeout.

Before I got there I already knew that I wanted shrimps and grits but my daughter had her heart set on having clam chowder. Sadly today was one of those days because of the heat in the state of Washington the clams are not coming in so there was no chowder to be made. But the rest of us looked over a wonderful menu that they prepare and selected our favorites and new favorites. I stuck with shrimp and grits my wife had the wonderful Safran muscles our daughter had the seared albacore tuna salad which was pretty amazing and her boyfriend had the Safran muscles as well. To everyone's surprise we were all immensely satisfied not only by his presentation in the size of the orders but the quality of the food. We all had happy taste buds. I also ordered a side of french fries for the muscles and a side of pickled vegetables for the table to share. The Fry's rifle in disappeared the pickled vegetables didn't really hit my taste buds the way I liked it but other people do table seem to like them.

Our server Billy took incredible care of us as guests. He visited our table several times but we've never stayed too long and answered all our questions and was extremely helpful for us in our selection. We're big fans of Billy's now.

Go look at the photos of her food really you'll understand how much we enjoyed it and the quality of the food that came out. That's probably the best shrimp and grits I've ever had and my grandmother was from the south. That's saying a lot. I've been there many times and I will continue going back either to Tomales Bay or this location in Larkspur.

Our server Billy was so nice helpful and professional.

Taste wise is as good as the one in SF. I think it's a bit more pricey though.. 

I do like the Grilled Bourbon Oyster, flavorful sauce with a hint of lemon drop... Wow, excellent taste.. Oyster is as fresh as you can get.. 

Steam mussel is not my forte though.. if it was grilled or pan fried, i would be more into it.. however the sauce that comes with has a kick in spiciness.. I use it to eat with fries.. lol

The fresh oyster is also good but i prefer the grill due to the sauce flavor complimenting the oyster.

Clam chowder is not the regular clam chowder you are a costume to.. this chowder is not thick but watery, but it comes with on the shell clams which is awesome.. no doubt the clams are there.. 

The only reason i don't give this page a five star is because they make my kids wait extra long for their grilled cheese sandwich which they did make it up by complimenting the food for us.. but still not good especially when the food is for kids..

The oysters are good- except when you get a piece of shell every now and then. The jalapeno & cilantro hogwash is delicious and addicting. The drinks are fantastic and crafted with care. The entrees and other bites I have had are average. The halibut ceviche was very dry it really needed to be in in the citrus sauce instead of just the pieces of fish. The baked oysters are ok- I have had better. The po boy sandwich is a bit of a mess and bland and the roll is way too much bread for the filling [plus not traditional]. This place is also extremely expensive- every time I come here the bill amongst 2-3 people is $120-$290. The last time I came with 2 other people we split 12 oysters, 1 ceviche, 2 po boy sandwiches and got 2 drinks each.... the total was $290!!!

By the time we left the place was packed, you would have thought they would be rushing us out, but exactly opposite, we had to wait and wait for our check.\nWe ordered just about one of everything, hummus, pita, dolmas (veggie and meat), rice, stuffed cabbage, falafel, beef kabob, chicken kabob, grilled shrimp, marinated olives...and I think something else?  The hummus is very good, the pita was warm and fluffy, the olives were just olives, the dolmas were great, and the sauce they serve with the falafel was a hint spicy and very good.\nSince we were celebrating, the owner brought out 'champagne' shots for all of us at the end of the meal.  It was a very nice touch.  I will definitely be back, and I was intrigued by the dinner for two menu.\n\nPro tip- arrive early on Tuesdays or prepare to wait."",""Date"":""06/08/2014"",""Images"":[],""User_Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/t_SDe3--pp0Jozdohtf7bw/60s.jpg"",""Username"":""Devin Q.""}]",506,"","0 check-in","Cafe Izmir",true
"cafe-izmir-dallas","""11/03/2014""",1,"I'm not sure if these other people have anything to compare  to. I have a friend from Israel and one from Iran. I have eaten a variety of things and have had the best coffee ever.  Their food is wonderful!
Last night I had hummus that was good, but way too much garlicky. The pita bread was also very good.  That's it!  Since this was our first visit we wanted to start out slow and order more if we liked it. We had the chicken kabob with veggies, falafel and baklava for dessert, with coffee.  The kabob and veggies were prepared perfectly, but had no seasoning. The falafel was dry and tasteless.  Even more disappointing was the baklava.  I have recently had two different baklavas my friends made. Very different, but both delicious. The baklava at Cafe Izmir was not good at all.  Again, no flavor.  The filling seemed like crushed FILO instead of the traditional nut filling, and not much of it at that. 
I was hoping to love this place, but I will not return.  The food is not up to my standard of Middle Eastern food.

"cafe-izmir-dallas","""20/07/2013""",1,"OK, so we asked about a vegetarian dish and they told us about the Vegetable Special for $25. I thought hmmm, seems a bit high for Vegetables. It included hummus, tzitziki, tabouli in containers. The hummus was good, tzitziki was good, tabouli was ok, not much tomatoes. Then there was rice, way too little, I mean c'mon rice is cheap give me at least a full portion. The bread was good and sufficient. 2 falafels with a green sauce (but way too little sauce), 2 dolmas that were decent. Grilled Vegies, completely undercooked and not cut up, maybe good for feeding a dog but does their chef not know how to cut up the vegies to bite size?? He would never make it in a Japanese restaurant. So main complaints they seemed very stingy on portions: Rice, falafel and dolmas and not enough sauce. Since it was take out we couldn't fix it.  Very bad experience for the price. Good thing the cute young persian waitress was very sweet. Just horrible chef for vegetarian. Maybe much better for Meat eaters.","{""Friends"":0,""Location"":""Mill Valley, CA"",""Photos"":0,""Reviews_made"":12,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=YhZkCwWxeL7mlBaNQvY4GA"",""Username"":""Sam C.""}","null","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""Hi Sam, I wanted to take a moment and thank you for visiting us at Cafe Izmir, and secondly, I wanted to apologize for your to go order not being to your satisfaction, we truly are sorry, Tuesday night we were so busy that our kitchen was over whelmed and we somehow  didn't check  to make  sure  your order was up to our standards, I would like to invite you back to try us one more time, we really try to make fresh food and give great service to all of our customers, we understand we are not perfect, and it shows by the food we must have  send you home with, again, please let us make this up to you by inviting you back to the cafe as our guest and let us try to make this up to you.\nThanks for your time and please let me know how I can help. my email address is beau@izmirgroup.com"",""Date"":""31/07/2013"",""Title"":""BizUserReviewReply"",""User_Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/buphoto/GhESDlmyvtLsCZCm1yAsEA/30s.jpg"",""Username"":""Beau N.""}]",702,"","0 check-in","Cafe Izmir",true
